Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is a condition in which the blood vessels do not develop properly in an area of the skin or other body organ (particularly the intestines).  The malformed blood vessels appear as a spot or lesion called a nevus.  The underlying blood vessel malformations are present from birth even though the nevus may not be visible until later in life. The size, number, location, and severity of these malformations vary from person to person.  Affected areas on the skin can be painful or tender to the touch and may be prone to sweating (hyperhidrosis).  Nevi in the intestines can bleed spontaneously and cause anemia or more serious complications. Other symptoms vary depending on the organ affected. Treatment is tailored to the individual depending on the location and symptoms caused by the affected areas.
 Currently the cause of blue rubber bleb syndrome is not known.
 Treatment of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome varies depending on the severity and location of the affected areas. Skin spots do not usually require treatment, but some individuals with this condition may want treatment for cosmetic reasons or if the location of the nevus causes discomfort or affects normal function. Bleeding in the intestines may be treated with iron supplements and blood transfusions when necessary. Surgery to remove an affected area of bowel may be recommended for repeated or severe bleeding (hemorrhage).
