                    Hypopharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the hypopharynx.
                    The hypopharynx is the bottom part of the pharynx (throat). The pharynx is a hollow tube about 5 inches long that starts behind the nose, goes down the neck, and ends at the top of the trachea (windpipe) and esophagus (the tube that goes from the throat to the stomach). Air and food pass through the pharynx on the way to the trachea or the esophagus.      Most hypopharyngeal cancers form in squamous cells, the thin, flat cells lining the inside of the hypopharynx. The hypopharynx has 3 different areas. Cancer may be found in 1 or more of these areas.   Hypopharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.
Use of tobacco products and heavy drinking can affect the risk of developing hypopharyngeal cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors include the following:         - Smoking tobacco.    - Chewing tobacco.    - Heavy alcohol use.    - Eating a diet without enough nutrients.    - Having Plummer-Vinson syndrome.
Signs and symptoms of hypopharyngeal cancer include a sore throat and ear pain. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by hypopharyngeal cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - A sore throat that does not go away.    - Ear pain.    - A lump in the neck.    - Painful or difficult swallowing.     - A change in voice.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The stage of the cancer (whether it affects part of the hypopharynx, involves the whole hypopharynx, or has spread to other places in the body). Hypopharyngeal cancer is usually detected in later stages because early signs and symptoms rarely occur.    - The patient's age, gender, and general health.     - The location of the cancer.    - Whether the patient smokes during radiation therapy.        Treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    - Keeping the patient's ability to talk, eat, and breathe as normal as possible.    - The patient's general health.        Patients who have had hypopharyngeal cancer are at an increased risk of developing a second cancer in the head or neck. Frequent and careful follow-up is important.
