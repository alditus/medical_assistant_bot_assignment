Menstruation, or period, is a woman's monthly bleeding. Abnormal vaginal bleeding is different from normal menstrual periods. It could be bleeding that is between periods, lasts several weeks, or happens before puberty or after menopause. Causes can include        - Uterine fibroids or polyps    - Hormone problems    - Hormone pills, such as birth control pills and menopausal hormone therapy    - Cancer of the cervix, ovaries, uterus or vagina    - Thyroid problems        Bleeding during pregnancy can have several different causes. It is not always a serious problem, but to be safe you should always contact your healthcare provider.      Pelvic exams, blood tests and other procedures can help your healthcare provider diagnose the problem. Treatment depends on the cause.
Vaginal cancer is a rare type of cancer. It is more common in women 60 and older. You are also more likely to get it if you have had a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or if your mother took diethylstilbestrol (DES) when she was pregnant. Doctors prescribed DES in the 1950's to prevent miscarriages. You are also at higher risk if you have had abnormal cells in the vagina, cervix, or uterus.    It often doesn't have early symptoms. However, see your doctor if you notice       - Bleeding that is not your period    - A vaginal lump     - Pelvic pain        A Pap test can find abnormal cells that may be cancer. Vaginal cancer can often be cured in its early stages. Treatment might include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.    NIH: National Cancer Institute
