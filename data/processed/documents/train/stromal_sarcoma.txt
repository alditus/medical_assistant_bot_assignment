Endometrial stromal sarcoma is a rare form of cancer that occurs due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth in the uterus. Endometrial stromal sarcoma, specifically, develops in the supporting connective tissue (stroma) of the uterus. Signs and symptoms of the condition include abnormal uterine bleeding (i.e. bleeding that is not part of menstrual periods or bleeding after menopause); abdominal pain and/or distension; and frequent urination. The exact underlying cause of endometrial stromal sarcoma is currently unknown. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Treatment varies based on the severity of the condition but may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormone therapy.
