You can become infected if you swallow the parasite.    The most common symptom of crypto is watery diarrhea. Other symptoms include       -  Dehydration     - Weight loss     -  Stomach cramps or pain     -  Fever     -  Nausea     -  Vomiting        Most people with crypto get better with no treatment, but crypto can cause serious problems in people with weak immune systems such as in people with HIV/AIDS.
