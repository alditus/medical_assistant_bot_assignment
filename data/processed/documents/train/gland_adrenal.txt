The adrenal glands are small glands located on top of each kidney. They produce hormones that you can't live without, including sex hormones and cortisol. Cortisol helps you respond to stress and has many other important functions.    With adrenal gland disorders, your glands make too much or not enough hormones. In Cushing's syndrome, there's too much cortisol, while with Addison's disease, there is too little. Some people are born unable to make enough cortisol.    Causes of adrenal gland disorders include       - Genetic mutations    - Tumors including pheochromocytomas    - Infections    - A problem in another gland, such as the pituitary, which helps to regulate the adrenal gland    - Certain medicines      Treatment depends on which problem you have. Surgery or medicines can treat many adrenal gland disorders.    NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Your adrenal, or suprarenal, glands are located on the top of each kidney. These glands produce hormones that you can't live without, including sex hormones and cortisol, which helps you respond to stress and has many other functions.    A number of disorders can affect the adrenal glands, including tumors. Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Most adrenal gland tumors are benign. They usually do not cause symptoms and may not require treatment. Malignant adrenal gland cancers are uncommon.    Types of tumors include       - Adrenocortical carcinoma - cancer in the outer part of the gland    - Neuroblastoma, a type of childhood cancer    - Pheochromocytoma - a rare tumor that is usually benign       Symptoms depend on the type of cancer you have. Treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.
