Cogan-Reese syndrome is one type of Iridocorneal Endothelial (ICE) syndrome. The ICE syndromes predominantly affect Caucasian, young to middle-aged women, and involve one eye. While there have been some cases of Cogan-Reese syndrome reported in children, the disease is typically observed in females in the mid-adult years. [1] In one study of 71 patients with ICE syndrome, the mean age at diagnosis was 51-years. Known glaucoma was present in 11 (15%) of cases. [2] While it is not yet known how to keep Cogan-Reese syndrome from progressing, the glaucoma associated with the disease can be treated with medication. Additionally, corneal transplant can treat any corneal swelling. The National Eye Institute provides information on screening for glaucoma HERE.
