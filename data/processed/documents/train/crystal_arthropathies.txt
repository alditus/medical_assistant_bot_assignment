Crystal arthropathies are a diverse group of bone diseases associated with the deposition of minerals within joints and the soft tissues around the joints. The group includes gout, basic calcium phosphate and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition diseases, and, in very rare cases, calcium oxalate crystal arthropathy which is a rare cause of arthritis characterized by deposition of calcium oxalate crystals within synovial fluid and typically occurs in patients with underlying primary or secondary hyperoxaluria. These crystals are responsible for different rheumatic syndromes, including acute or chronic synovial inflammation and cartilage degeneration. Treatment depends on the specific condition.
