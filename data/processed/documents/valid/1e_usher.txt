Usher syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by hearing loss or deafness, and progressive vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa. Three major types of Usher syndrome have been described - types I, II, and III.  The different types are distinguished by their severity and the age when signs and symptoms appear. All three types are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell have mutations.
 The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Usher syndrome, type 1E. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Congenital sensorineural hearing impairment - Rod-cone dystrophy - Vestibular areflexia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.
 Usher syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that a person must have a change (mutation) in both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell to have Usher syndrome. One mutated copy is typically inherited from each parent, who are each referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition usually do not have any signs or symptoms. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to not be a carrier and not be affected.
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1E (CMT1E) is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which is a group of rare conditions that affect the peripheral nerves. Signs and symptoms of CMT1E generally become apparent between age 5 and 25 years, although the age of onset and disease severity can vary significantly from person to person. In general, CMT1E is associated with the typical features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (progressive weakness of the feet and/or ankles; foot drop; atrophy of muscles below the knee; absent tendon reflexes of upper and lower extremities; and a decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the feet and/or lower legs) in addition to hearing loss. CMT1E is caused by certain changes (mutations) in the PMP22 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.
