The exact prevalence of cyclic vomiting syndrome is unknown; estimates range from 4 to 2,000 per 100,000 children. The condition is diagnosed less frequently in adults, although recent studies suggest that the condition may begin in adulthood as commonly as it begins in childhood.
Although the causes of cyclic vomiting syndrome have yet to be determined, researchers have proposed several factors that may contribute to the disorder. These factors include changes in brain function, hormonal abnormalities, and gastrointestinal problems. Many researchers believe that cyclic vomiting syndrome is a migraine-like condition, which suggests that it is related to changes in signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in certain areas of the brain. Many affected individuals have abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. Based on these abnormalities, cystic vomiting syndrome is often classified as a type of dysautonomia.  Some cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome, particularly those that begin in childhood, may be related to changes in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).  Several changes in mitochondrial DNA have been associated with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Some of these changes alter single DNA building blocks (nucleotides), whereas others rearrange larger segments of mitochondrial DNA. These changes likely impair the ability of mitochondria to produce energy. Researchers speculate that the impaired mitochondria may cause certain cells of the autonomic nervous system to malfunction, which could affect the digestive system. However, it remains unclear how changes in mitochondrial function could cause episodes of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy; abdominal pain; or migraines in people with this condition.
In most cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome, affected people have no known history of the disorder in their family. However, many affected individuals have a family history of related conditions, such as migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, or depression, in their mothers and other maternal relatives. This family history suggests an inheritance pattern known as maternal inheritance or mitochondrial inheritance, which applies to genes contained in mtDNA. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtDNA mutations from their mother. These disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtDNA to their children.  Occasionally, people with cyclic vomiting syndrome have a family history of the disorder that does not follow maternal inheritance. In these cases, the inheritance pattern is unknown.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome, sometimes referred to as CVS, is an increasingly recognized disorder with sudden, repeated attacksalso called episodesof severe nausea, vomiting, and physical exhaustion that occur with no apparent cause. The episodes can last from a few hours to several days. Episodes can be so severe that a person has to stay in bed for days, unable to go to school or work. A person may need treatment at an emergency room or a hospital during episodes. After an episode, a person usually experiences symptom-free periods lasting a few weeks to several months. To people who have the disorder, as well as their family members and friends, cyclic vomiting syndrome can be disruptive and frightening.
                
The disorder can affect a person for months, years, or decades. Each episode of cyclic vomiting syndrome is usually similar to previous ones, meaning that episodes tend to start at the same time of day, last the same length of time, and occur with the same symptoms and level of intensity.
The cause of cyclic vomiting syndrome is unknown. However, some experts believe that some possible problems with bodily functions may contribute to the cause, such as the following:
                
- gastrointestinal motilitythe way food moves through the digestive system  - central nervous system functionincludes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves that control bodily responses  - autonomic nervous system functionnerves that control internal organs such as the heart  - hormone imbalanceshormones are a chemical produced in one part of the body and released into the blood to trigger or regulate particular bodily functions  - in children, an abnormal inherited gene may also contribute to the condition
                
Specific conditions or events may trigger an episode of cyclic vomiting:
                
- emotional stress, anxiety, or panic attacksfor example, in children, common triggers of anticipatory anxiety are school exams or events, birthday parties, holidays, family conflicts, or travel  - infections, such as a sinus infection, a respiratory infection, or the flu  - eating certain foods, such as chocolate or cheese, or additives such as caffeine, nitritescommonly found in cured meats such as hot dogsand monosodium glutamate, also called MSG  - hot weather  - menstrual periods  - motion sickness  - overeating, fasting, or eating right before bedtime  - physical exhaustion or too much exercise
Cyclic vomiting syndrome is more common in children than adults, although reports of the syndrome in adults have increased in recent years.1 Usually, children are about 5 years old when diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome, which occurs in every three out of 100,000 children.2
The main symptoms of cyclic vomiting syndrome are severe nausea and sudden vomiting lasting hours to days. A person may also experience one or more of the following symptoms:
                
- retching, or making an attempt to vomit  - heaving or gagging  - lack of appetite  - abdominal pain  - diarrhea  - fever  - dizziness  - headache  - sensitivity to light
                
Intensity of symptoms will vary as a person cycles through four distinct phases of an episode:
                
- Prodrome phase. During the prodrome phase, the person feels that an episode of nausea and vomiting is about to start. Often marked by intense sweating and nauseawith or without abdominal painthis phase can last from a few minutes to several hours. The person may appear unusually pale.  - Vomiting phase. This phase consists of intense nausea, vomiting, and retching. Periods of vomiting and retching can last 20 to 30 minutes at a time. The person may be subdued and responsive, immobile and unresponsive, or writhing and moaning with intense abdominal pain. An episode can last from hours to days.  - Recovery phase. This phase begins when the vomiting and retching stop and the nausea subsides. Improvement of symptoms during the recovery phase can vary. Healthy color, appetite, and energy return gradually or right away.  - Well phase. This phase occurs between episodes when no symptoms are present.
The severe vomiting and retching that define cyclic vomiting syndrome increase the chance of developing several complications, including dehydration, esophagitis, a Mallory-Weiss tear, and tooth decay.
                
- Dehydration may occur when a person does not replace fluids that were lost because of vomiting and diarrhea. When dehydrated, the body lacks enough fluid and electrolytesminerals in salts, including sodium, potassium, and chlorideto function properly. Severe dehydration may require intravenous (IV) fluids and hospitalization.  - Esophagitisinflammation or irritation of the esophaguscan result from the stomach acid that exits through the esophagus during vomiting.  - A Mallory-Weiss teara tear in the lower end of the esophagusis caused by severe vomiting. A person with bloody vomit and stool should see a health care provider right away.  - Tooth decay or corroding tooth enamel is damage caused by stomach acid.
                

                
Seek Help for Signs or Symptoms of Severe Dehydration   People who have any signs or symptoms of severe dehydration should call or see a health care provider right away:   - excessive thirst   - dark-colored urine   - infrequent urination   - lethargy, dizziness, or faintness   - dry skin    Infants, children, older adults, and people with weak immune systems have the greatest chance of becoming dehydrated. People should watch for the following signs and symptoms of dehydration in infants, young children, and people who are unable to communicate their symptoms:   - dry mouth and tongue   - lack of tears when crying   - infants with no wet diapers for 3 hours or more   - infants with a sunken soft spot   - unusually cranky or drowsy behavior   - sunken eyes or cheeks   - fever    If left untreated, severe dehydration can cause serious health problems, such as organ damage, shock, or comaa sleeplike state in which a person is not conscious.
A person should stay away from known triggers, especially during the well phase, as well as
                
- get adequate sleep to prevent exhaustion  - treat sinus problems or allergies  - seek help on reducing stress and anxiety  - avoid foods that trigger episodes or foods with additives
                
A health care provider may refer people with cyclic vomiting syndrome and anxiety to a stress management specialist for relaxation therapy or other treatments.
                
A health care provider may prescribe medications to prevent migraines for people with cyclic vomiting syndrome.
During the prodrome and vomiting phases of cyclic vomiting syndrome, a person will generally take in little or no nutrition by mouth. During the recovery phase, the person may be quite hungry as soon as the vomiting stops. As eating resumes, a person or his or her family should watch for the return of nausea. In some cases, a person can start with clear liquids and proceed slowly to a regular diet.
                
During the well phase, a balanced diet and regular meals are important. People should avoid any trigger foods and foods with additives. Eating small, carbohydrate-containing snacks between meals, before exercise, and at bedtime may help prevent future attacks. A health care provider will assist with planning a return to a regular diet.
