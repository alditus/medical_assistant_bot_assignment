Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are done with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are done with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.
                
                
                    New ways to prevent oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.
                    Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI website. Check NCI's list of cancer clinical trials for oral cavity cancer prevention trials and oropharyngeal cancer prevention trials that are now accepting patients.
The number of new cases of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer and the number of deaths from oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer varies by race and gender. Over the past ten years, the number of new cases and deaths from oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer slightly increased in white men and women. The number slightly decreased among black men and women.   Oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer is more common in men than in women. Although oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer may occur in adults of any age, it occurs most often in those aged 55 to 64 years.   France, Brazil, and parts of Asia have much higher rates of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer than most other countries.    The number of new cases of oropharyngeal cancer caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has increased. One kind of HPV, called HPV 16, is often passed from one person to another during sexual activity.
Key Points
                    - Lip and oral cavity cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lips or mouth.    - Tobacco and alcohol use can affect the risk of lip and oral cavity cancer.     - Signs of lip and oral cavity cancer include a sore or lump on the lips or in the mouth.     - Tests that examine the mouth and throat are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage lip and oral cavity cancer.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Lip and oral cavity cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lips or mouth.
                    The oral cavity includes the following:         - The front two thirds of the tongue.    - The gingiva (gums).    - The buccal mucosa (the lining of the inside of the cheeks).    - The floor (bottom) of the mouth under the tongue.    - The hard palate (the roof of the mouth).    - The retromolar trigone (the small area behind the wisdom teeth).          Most lip and oral cavity cancers start in squamous cells, the thin, flat cells that line the lips and oral cavity. These are called squamous cell carcinomas. Cancer cells may spread into deeper tissue as the cancer grows. Squamous cell carcinoma usually develops in areas of leukoplakia (white patches of cells that do not rub off).    Lip and oral cavity cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.
Tobacco and alcohol use can affect the risk of lip and oral cavity cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for lip and oral cavity cancer include the following:         - Using tobacco products.    - Heavy alcohol use.    - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.    - Being male.
Signs of lip and oral cavity cancer include a sore or lump on the lips or in the mouth. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by lip and oral cavity cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:          - A sore on the lip or in the mouth that does not heal.    - A lump or thickening on the lips or gums or in the mouth.    - A white or red patch on the gums, tongue, or lining of the mouth.    - Bleeding, pain, or numbness in the lip or mouth.    - Change in voice.    - Loose teeth or dentures that no longer fit well.    - Trouble chewing or swallowing or moving the tongue or jaw.    - Swelling of jaw.    - Sore throat or feeling that something is caught in the throat.        Lip and oral cavity cancer may not have any symptoms and is sometimes found during a regular dental exam.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    - Where the tumor is in the lip or oral cavity.    - Whether the cancer has spread to blood vessels.        For patients who smoke, the chance of recovery is better if they stop smoking before beginning radiation therapy.   Treatment options depend on the following:          - The stage of the cancer.    - The size of the tumor and where it is in the lip or oral cavity.    - Whether the patient's appearance and ability to talk and eat can stay the same.    - The patient's age and general health.        Patients who have had lip and oral cavity cancer have an increased risk of developing a second cancer in the head or neck. Frequent and careful follow-up is important. Clinical trials are studying the use of retinoid drugs to reduce the risk of a second head and neck cancer. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
Oral cancer can form in any part of the mouth or throat. Most oral cancers begin in the tongue and in the floor of the mouth. Anyone can get oral cancer, but the risk is higher if you are male, over age 40, use tobacco or alcohol or have a history of head or neck cancer. Frequent sun exposure is also a risk for lip cancer.     Symptoms of oral cancer include        -  White or red patches in your mouth    -  A mouth sore that won't heal    -  Bleeding in your mouth    - Loose teeth    -  Problems or pain with swallowing    -  A lump in your neck    -  An earache       Oral cancer treatments may include surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Some patients have a combination of treatments.     NIH: National Cancer Institute
