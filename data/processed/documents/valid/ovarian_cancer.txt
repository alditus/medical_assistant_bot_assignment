The ovaries are a pair of organs that women have. They are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond.    The ovaries produce a woman's eggs. If an egg is fertilized by a sperm, a pregnancy can result. Ovaries also make the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. When a woman goes through menopause, her ovaries stop releasing eggs and make far lower levels of hormones.    Problems with the ovaries include       - Ovarian cancer    - Ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome    - Premature ovarian failure    - Ovarian torsion, a twisting of the ovary
The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. They produce a woman's eggs and female hormones. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond.    Cancer of the ovary is not common, but it causes more deaths than other female reproductive cancers. The sooner ovarian cancer is found and treated, the better your chance for recovery. But ovarian cancer is hard to detect early. Women with ovarian cancer may have no symptoms or just mild symptoms until the disease is in an advanced stage. Then it is hard to treat. Symptoms may include       - A heavy feeling in the pelvis    - Pain in the lower abdomen    -  Bleeding from the vagina    -  Weight gain or loss    -  Abnormal periods    -  Unexplained back pain that gets worse    -  Gas, nausea, vomiting, or loss of appetite       To diagnose ovarian cancer, doctors do one or more tests. They include a physical exam, a pelvic exam, lab tests, ultrasound, or a biopsy. Treatment is usually surgery followed by chemotherapy.    NIH: National Cancer Institute
Childhood ovarian cancer is a rare type of cancer that occurs due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth in the ovaries. The childhood form, specifically, is extremely rare and accounts for less than 5% of all ovarian cancer cases. The most common types of ovarian cancers diagnosed in children and adolescents include germ cell tumors, followed by epithelial tumors, stromal tumors, and then other tumors (such as Burkitt lymphoma and small cell carcinoma of the ovary). Many people with early ovarian cancer have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, symptoms may include painful menstrual periods; an abdominal lump; pain or swelling in the abdomen; having male sex traits (i.e. body hair or a deep voice); and/or early signs of puberty. The underlying cause of childhood ovarian cancer is often unknown. Certain inherited conditions, such as Ollier disease, Maffucci syndrome and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are associated with an increased risk of developing childhood ovarian cancer. Treatment varies based on many factors including the type of ovarian tumor and the severity of the condition. It may include surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.
Ovarian cancer affects about 12 in 100,000 women per year.
Most cases of ovarian cancer are not caused by inherited genetic factors. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that are acquired during a person's lifetime, and they do not cluster in families.  A predisposition to cancer caused by a germline mutation is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing cancer. Although ovarian cancer occurs only in women, the mutated gene can be inherited from either the mother or the father. It is important to note that people inherit an increased likelihood of developing cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will ultimately develop cancer.  In many cases of ovarian cancer that clusters in families, the genetic basis for the disease and the mechanism of inheritance are unclear.
