A balance disorder is a disturbance of the body systems controlling balance. This disturbance can make people feel dizzy, unsteady, or as if they were spinning. Balance disorders are a common cause of falls and fall-related injuries, such as hip fractures.
In 2008, an estimated 14.8 percent of American adults (33.4 million) had a balance or dizziness problem during the past year. See statistics about the frequency of balance and other sensory impairments in older adults.  (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
If you have a balance disorder, you may stagger when you try to walk, or teeter or fall when you try to stand up. You might experience other symptoms such as -  dizziness or vertigo (a spinning sensation)  -  falling or feeling as if you are going to fall  -  lightheadedness, faintness, or a floating sensation  -  blurred vision  -  confusion or disorientation.  dizziness or vertigo (a spinning sensation) falling or feeling as if you are going to fall lightheadedness, faintness, or a floating sensation blurred vision confusion or disorientation. Other symptoms might include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, and fear, anxiety, or panic. Symptoms may come and go over short time periods or last for a long time, and can lead to fatigue and depression.
Some balance disorders are caused by problems in the inner ear. The part of the inner ear that is responsible for balance is the vestibular system, often refered to as the labyrinth. When the labyrinth becomes infected or swollen -- a condition called labyrinthitis -- it is typically accompanied by vertigo and imbalance. Upper respiratory infections, other viral infections, and, less commonly, bacterial infections, can lead to labyrinthitis. Other balance disorders may involve another part of the body, such as the brain or the heart. For example, diseases of the circulatory system, such as stroke, can cause dizziness and other balance problems. Smoking and diabetes can increase the risk of stroke. Low blood pressure also can cause dizziness. Aging, infections, head injury, and many medicines may also result in a balance problem.
An ear infection called otitis media can cause balance problems. Otitis media is most common in children, but adults can get it, too. You can help prevent otitis media by washing your hands frequently. Also, talk to your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot to stave off flu-related ear infections. If you do get an ear infection, see a doctor immediately before it becomes more serious. Learn more about otitis media and other ear infections.  (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
In BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo), small calcium particles in the inner ear become displaced, causing dizziness. A doctor, otolaryngologist, audiologist, or physical therapist can treat BPPV by carefully moving the head and torso to move the displaced calcium particles back to their original position Learn more about causes and treatments for BPPV. An NIDCD-supported clinical trial in BPPV showed that repositioning maneuvers work well, and offered clinicians a range of choices in selecting the treatment best suited to each individuals unique needs.
