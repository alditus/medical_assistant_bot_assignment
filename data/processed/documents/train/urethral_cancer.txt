Signs of urethral cancer include bleeding or trouble with urination. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by urethral cancer or by other conditions. There may be no signs or symptoms in the early stages. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - Trouble starting the flow of urine.    - Weak or interrupted ("stop-and-go") flow of urine.    - Frequent urination, especially at night.    -  Incontinence.    -  Discharge from the urethra.    - Bleeding from the urethra or blood in the urine.    - A lump or thickness in the perineum or penis.    - A painless lump or swelling in the groin.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:          - Where the cancer formed in the urethra.    - Whether the cancer has spread through the mucosa lining the urethra to nearby tissue, to lymph nodes, or to other parts of the body.    - Whether the patient is a male or female.    - The patient's general health.    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).
The urethra is the tube that allows urine to pass out of the body. In men, it's a long tube that runs through the penis. It also carries semen in men. In women, it's short and is just above the vagina. Urethral problems may happen due to aging, illness, or injury. They include       - Urethral stricture - a narrowing of the opening of the urethra    - Urethritis - inflammation of the urethra, sometimes caused by infection       Urethral problems may cause pain or difficulty passing urine. You may also have bleeding or discharge from the urethra.    Doctors diagnose urethral problems using different tests. These include urine tests, x-rays and an examination of the urethra with a scope called a cystoscope. Treatment depends on the cause of the problem. It may include medicines and, in severe cases, surgery.
