Being exposed to certain chemicals or dust in the workplace can increase the risk of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer include the following:          - Being exposed to certain workplace chemicals or dust, such as those found in the following jobs:               - Furniture-making.      - Sawmill work.      - Woodworking (carpentry).      - Shoemaking.      - Metal-plating.      - Flour mill or bakery work.             - Being infected with human papillomavirus (HPV).    - Being male and older than 40 years.    - Smoking.
Signs of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer include sinus problems and nosebleeds. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer or by other conditions. There may be no signs or symptoms in the early stages. Signs and symptoms may appear as the tumor grows. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - Blocked sinuses that do not clear, or sinus pressure.    - Headaches or pain in the sinus areas.    - A runny nose.    - Nosebleeds.    - A lump or sore inside the nose that does not heal.    - A lump on the face or roof of the mouth.    - Numbness or tingling in the face.    - Swelling or other trouble with the eyes, such as double vision or the eyes pointing in different directions.    - Pain in the upper teeth, loose teeth, or dentures that no longer fit well.    - Pain or pressure in the ear.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - Where the tumor is in the paranasal sinus or nasal cavity and whether it has spread.    - The size of the tumor.    - The type of cancer.    - The patient's age and general health.    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).        Paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancers often have spread by the time they are diagnosed and are hard to cure. After treatment, a lifetime of frequent and careful follow-up is important because there is an increased risk of developing a second kind of cancer in the head or neck.
Your paranasal sinuses are small hollow spaces around the nose. They are lined with cells that make mucus, which keeps your nose from drying out. The nasal cavity is the passageway just behind your nose. Air passes through it on the way to your throat as you breathe.    Cancer of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses is rare. You are at greater risk if you are       - Male and over 40 years old    - Exposed to certain workplace chemicals    - Infected with HPV    - A smoker       There may be no symptoms at first, and later symptoms can be like those of infections. Doctors diagnose nasal cancer with imaging tests, lighted tube-like instruments that look inside the nose, and biopsies. Treatment options include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.
