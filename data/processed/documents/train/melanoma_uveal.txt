Being older and having fair skin may increase the risk of intraocular melanoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.    Risk factors for intraocular melanoma include the following:         - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.      - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.             - Older age.    - Being white.
Signs of intraocular melanoma include blurred vision or a dark spot on the iris. Intraocular melanoma may not cause early signs or symptoms. It is sometimes found during a regular eye exam when the doctor dilates the pupil and looks into the eye. Signs and symptoms may be caused by intraocular melanoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - Blurred vision or other change in vision.    - Floaters (spots that drift in your field of vision) or flashes of light.    - A dark spot on the iris.    - A change in the size or shape of the pupil.    - A change in the position of the eyeball in the eye socket.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:          - How the melanoma cells look under a microscope.    - The size and thickness of the tumor.    - The part of the eye the tumor is in (the iris, ciliary body, or choroid).    - Whether the tumor has spread within the eye or to other places in the body.    - Whether there are certain changes in the genes linked to intraocular melanoma.    - The patient's age and general health.    - Whether the tumor has recurred (come back) after treatment.
