Werner's syndrome is a disease chiefly characterized by premature aging and cancer predisposition. Development is typically normal until the end of the first decade; the first sign is the lack of a growth spurt during puberty. Early signs (usually in the 20s) include loss and graying of hair, hoarseness, and scleroderma-like skin changes, followed by cataracts, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypogonadism, skin ulcers, and osteoporosis in the 30s. Myocardial infarction (heart attack) and cancer are the most common causes of death, which typically occurs in the late 40s. It is caused by mutations in the WRN gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Management focuses on treatment of signs and symptoms and prevention of secondary complications.
