Summary : Caregivers provide help to another person in need. The person receiving care may be an adult - often a parent or a spouse - or a child with special medical needs. Some caregivers are family members. Others are paid. They do many things:       - Shop for food and cook    - Clean the house    - Pay bills    - Give medicine    - Help the person go to the toilet, bathe and dress    - Help the person eat    - Provide company and emotional support       Caregiving is hard, and caregivers of chronically ill people often feel stress. They are "on call" 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you're caring for someone with mental problems like Alzheimer's disease  it can be especially difficult. Support groups can help.

Caring for someone who has Alzheimer's disease  (AD) can be stressful and overwhelming. It's important to take care of yourself. Ask for and accept help.    Talk to the doctor. Find out what treatments might help control symptoms or address behavior problems. Find a support group. Others who have "been there" may be able to help and will understand.     If there are times of day that the person is less confused or more cooperative, take advantage of that in daily routines. Consider using adult day care or respite services. These offer a break with the peace of mind that the patient is being taken care of. Begin to plan for the future. This may include        -  Getting financial and legal documents in order    -  Looking into assisted living or nursing homes    -  Finding out what your health insurance and Medicare will cover       NIH: National Institute on Aging
