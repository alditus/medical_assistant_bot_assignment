HEM (hydrops fetalis, ectopic calcifications, "moth-eaten" skeletal dysplasia) is a very rare type of lethal skeletal dysplasia. According to the reported cases of HEM in the medical literature, the condition's main features are hydrops fetalis, dwarfism with severely shortened limbs and relatively normal-sized hands and feet, a "moth-eaten" appearance of the skeleton, flat vertebral bodies and ectopic calcifications. HEM is an autosomal recessive condition caused by a mutation in the lamin B receptor (LBR) gene. No treatment or cure is currently known for HEM.
 HEM is associated with mutations (changes) in the lamin B receptor (LBR) gene located on chromosome 1, specifically at 1q42.1.  Each person has two copies of the LBR gene - one inherited from mom and the other from dad. People who have two mutated copies of the LBR gene have HEM; thus, the condition is said to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The presence of two mutated copies of the LBR gene may affect the structure of the nucleus of the cell as well.
 Establishing a diagnosis of HEM prenatally can be difficult and may require the interaction between a perinatologist, geneticist, and fetal/neonatal pathologist. Clinical examination, radiographs, genetic testing, and autopsy may be performed in order to establish a diagnosis of HEM.
