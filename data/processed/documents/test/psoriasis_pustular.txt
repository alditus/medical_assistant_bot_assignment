Psoriasis (sow RYE uh sis) is a chronic skin disease. Chronic means that it lasts a long time, often a lifetime. Psoriasis affects more than 5 million adults in the United States. It appears about equally in males and females. Psoriasis occurs when the skin cells grow too quickly. The body does not shed these excess cells and they build up on the surface of the skin, forming thick, scaly patches.   Types of Psoriasis Psoriasis occurs in five different forms that affect both men and women. Most people have only one type of psoriasis at a time. Sometimes, one type of psoriasis will disappear and another will appear. Here is a brief overview of the different forms of psoriasis. - Is the most common form  - appears as raised red patches covered in silvery white scales   - usually shows up on the scalp, knees, elbows and lower back   - patches may itch or be painful and can also crack and bleed.

Although the cause of psoriasis is not completely understood, scientists believe it is related to a problem with a type of blood cells called T cells. These cells normally travel through the bloodstream to help fight an infection, but in people with psoriasis, they attack the bodys skin cells by mistake. Genes Play a Role No one knows what causes T cells to go wrong, but certain genes have been linked to psoriasis. People who have these genes are more likely to develop psoriasis than people without the genes. However, genes alone do not cause psoriasis. Scientists believe psoriasis occurs when something in the environment triggers the disease in someone who has one or more of these genes.  Psoriasis Triggers These so-called triggers may be different for different people. Different triggers may start the disease or make it worse in different people. Factors that may trigger psoriasis or make it worse include - physical and emotional stress  - injury to the skin such as cuts or burns  - infections, particularly strep throat  - cold weather   - smoking or heavy alcohol use  - certain medications such as     - lithium, a psychiatric drug   - antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine    - inderal, a high blood pressure medicine   - quinidine, a heart medication   - indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used to treat arthritis.   physical and emotional stress injury to the skin such as cuts or burns infections, particularly strep throat cold weather smoking or heavy alcohol use certain medications such as - lithium, a psychiatric drug  - antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine   - inderal, a high blood pressure medicine  - quinidine, a heart medication  - indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used to treat arthritis. lithium, a psychiatric drug antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine inderal, a high blood pressure medicine quinidine, a heart medication indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used to treat arthritis.
Different forms of psoriasis have different symptoms. In many cases your doctor can diagnose psoriasis based on the signs seen in the physical exam as well as the symptoms you describe. Symptoms The most common symptoms of psoriasis are - patches of thick, red skin   - skin inflammation  - silvery scales  - itching  - pain. patches of thick, red skin skin inflammation silvery scales itching pain. Psoriasis most commonly affects the elbows, knees, scalp, lower back, face, palms, soles of the feet, nails, and soft tissues. Making a Diagnosis In most cases, your primary care provider can diagnose psoriasis simply by examining your skin. Because the symptoms of psoriasis may be similar to those of other skin diseases, however, sometimes the diagnosis is more difficult. You may need to see a dermatologist, a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating skin diseases. If your doctor isn't sure if you have psoriasis, he or she may order a biopsy. This involves removing a small sample of skin and looking at it under a microscope.

The goals of psoriasis treatment are to change the course of the disease by interfering with the increased production of skin cells, and to remove scales and smooth rough skin.
Generalized pustular psoriasis is a severe inflammatory skin condition that can be life-threatening. Affected people develop episodes of red and tender skin with widespread pustules throughout their body. This is generally accompanied by fever, chills, headache, rapid pulse rate, loss of appetite, nausea and muscle weakness. The condition generally resolves within days or weeks; however, relapses are common. Some cases of generalized pustular psoriasis are caused by changes (mutations) in the IL36RN gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Possible triggers for sporadic forms of the condition include withdrawal from corticosteroids, exposure to certain medications, and/or infection; however, in many cases, the underlying cause is unknown. Generalized pustular psoriasis can be life threatening, so hospitalization and a specialist's care is usually required. Affected areas are treated with topical (on the skin) compresses with emollients and/or steroid creams. Certain medications may also be recommended to manage non-skin-related symptoms.
The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Generalized pustular psoriasis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cholangitis 5% Furrowed tongue 5% Nail dysplasia 5% Nail dystrophy 5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Erythema - Fever - Parakeratosis - Psoriasis - Pustule - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.
Pustular psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that is characterized by widespread pustules and reddish skin. This condition can occur alone or with plaque-type psoriasis. Most cases of pustular psoriasis are thought to be "multifactorial" or associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. There are several triggers for this conditions including withdrawal from corticosteroids, exposure to various medications and/or infections. Some cases of the generalized form are caused by changes (mutations) in the IL36RN gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In severe cases, hospitalization may be required. Treatment aims to alleviate the associated symptoms and may include certain medications and/or phototherapy.
Guttate psoriasis is a skin condition in which small, red, and scaly teardrop-shaped spots appear on the arms, legs, and middle of the body. It is a relatively uncommon form of psoriasis. The condition often develops very suddenly, and is usually triggered by an infection (e.g., strep throat, bacteria infection, upper respiratory infections or other viral infections). Other triggers include injury to the skin, including cuts, burns, and insect bites, certain malarial and heart medications, stress, sunburn, and excessive alcohol consumption. Treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms, ranging from at-home over the counter remedies to medicines that suppress the body's immune system to sunlight and phototherapy.
 The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms and prevent secondary infections. Mild cases of guttate psoriasis are usually treated at home. The following may be recommended: Cortisone (anti-itch and anti-inflammatory) cream Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription) Lotions that contain coal tar Moisturizers Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids) People with very severe guttate psoriasis may take medicines to suppress the body's immune system. These medicines include corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and methotrexate. Sunlight may help some symptoms go away. Care should be taken to avoid sunburn. Some people may choose to have phototherapy. Phototherapy is a medical procedure in which the skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. Phototherapy may be given alone or after taking a drug that makes the skin more sensitive to light.
