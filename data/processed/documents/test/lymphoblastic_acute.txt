Signs and symptoms of adult ALL include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding. The early signs and symptoms of ALL may be like the flu or other common diseases. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - Weakness or feeling tired.    -  Fever or night sweats.    - Easy bruising or bleeding.    -  Petechiae (flat, pinpoint spots under the skin, caused by bleeding).    - Shortness of breath.    - Weight loss or loss of appetite.    - Pain in the bones or stomach.    - Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs.    - Painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin.    - Having many infections.        These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia or by other conditions.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The age of the patient.    - Whether the cancer has spread to the brain or spinal cord.    - Whether there are certain changes in the genes, including the Philadelphia chromosome.    - Whether the cancer has been treated before or has recurred (come back).
Previous chemotherapy and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of developing ALL. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Possible risk factors for ALL include the following:         - Being male.    - Being white.    - Being older than 70.    - Past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.    - Being exposed to high levels of radiation in the environment (such as nuclear radiation).    - Having certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome.
Signs of childhood ALL include fever and bruising. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood ALL or by other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:         -  Fever.    - Easy bruising or bleeding.    -  Petechiae (flat, pinpoint, dark-red spots under the skin caused by bleeding).    - Bone or joint pain.    - Painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin.    - Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs.    - Weakness, feeling tired, or looking pale.    - Loss of appetite.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on:         - How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after the first month of treatment.    - Age at the time of diagnosis, gender, race, and ethnic background.    - The number of white blood cells in the blood at the time of diagnosis.    - Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes with cancer.    - Whether the child has Down syndrome.    - Whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid.    - The child's weight at the time of diagnosis and during treatment.        Treatment options depend on:         - Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.    - Whether the child has standard-risk, high-risk, or very highrisk ALL.    - The age of the child at the time of diagnosis.    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes, such as the Philadelphia chromosome.    - Whether the child was treated with steroids before the start of induction therapy.    - How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops during treatment.        For leukemia that relapses (comes back) after treatment, the prognosis and treatment options depend partly on the following:         - How long it is between the time of diagnosis and when the leukemia comes back.    - Whether the leukemia comes back in the bone marrow or in other parts of the body.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy     CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL that has relapsed (come back) a second time.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
