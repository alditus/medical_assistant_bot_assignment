Gender and age may affect the risk of hairy cell leukemia. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. The cause of hairy cell leukemia is unknown. It occurs more often in older men.
Signs and symptoms of hairy cell leukemia include infections, tiredness, and pain below the ribs. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by hairy cell leukemia or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:          - Weakness or feeling tired.    -  Fever or frequent infections.    - Easy bruising or bleeding.    - Shortness of breath.    - Weight loss for no known reason.    - Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs.    - Painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin.
Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery). The treatment options may depend on the following:         - The number of hairy (leukemia) cells and healthy blood cells in the blood and bone marrow.    - Whether the spleen is swollen.    - Whether there are signs or symptoms of leukemia, such as infection.    - Whether the leukemia has recurred (come back) after previous treatment.        The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - Whether the hairy cell leukemia does not grow or grows so slowly it does not need treatment.    - Whether the hairy cell leukemia responds to treatment.        Treatment often results in a long-lasting remission (a period during which some or all of the signs and symptoms of the leukemia are gone). If the leukemia returns after it has been in remission, retreatment often causes another remission.
Key Points
                    - There is no standard staging system for hairy cell leukemia.
                
                
                    There is no standard staging system for hairy cell leukemia.
                    Staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread. Groups are used in place of stages for hairy cell leukemia. The disease is grouped as untreated, progressive, or refractory.       Untreated hairy cell leukemia     The hairy cell leukemia is newly diagnosed and has not been treated except to relieve signs or symptoms such as weight loss and infections. In untreated hairy cell leukemia, some or all of the following conditions occur:            - Hairy (leukemia) cells are found in the blood and bone marrow.     - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets may be lower than normal.     - The spleen may be larger than normal.                Progressive hairy cell leukemia     In progressive hairy cell leukemia, the leukemia has been treated with either chemotherapy or splenectomy (removal of the spleen) and one or both of the following conditions occur:            - There is an increase in the number of hairy cells in the blood or bone marrow.     - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets in the blood is lower than normal.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                 
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                 
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
Hairy cell leukemia is a rare, slow-growing cancer of the blood in which the bone marrow makes too many B cells (lymphocytes), a type of white blood cell that fights infection. The condition is named after these excess B cells which look 'hairy' under a microscope. As the number of leukemia cells increases, fewer healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets are produced. The underlying cause of this condition is unknown. While there is no cure, treatment can lead to remission which can last for years.
