De Barsy syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized mainly by a prematurely aged-looking face (progeria); cloudy corneas; short stature; and intellectual disability. Affected individuals can have a wide variety of other signs and symptoms, including loose skin folds due to reduced elasticity (cutis laxa); poor muscle tone (hypotonia); movement disorders; and other features that involve the eyes, face, skin and nervous system. The genetic cause of the condition is not known in most cases, but it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment generally focuses on the signs and symptoms present in each individual and may include early eye surgery and physiotherapy to avoid contractures.
