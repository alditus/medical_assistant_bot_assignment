Goldenhar disease is a condition that is present at birth and mainly affects the development of the eye, ear and spine. Affected individuals commonly have a partially formed ear (microtia) or totally absent ear (anotia), noncancerous (benign) growths of the eye (ocular dermoid cysts), and spinal abnormalities. Goldenhar disease may also affect the facial structure, heart, lungs, kidneys, and central nervous system. The underlying cause of the condition remains unknown.
