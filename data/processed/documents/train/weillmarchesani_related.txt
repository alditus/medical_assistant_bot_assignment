Weill-Marchesani syndrome is an inherited connective tissue disorder that mainly affects the bones and eyes. People with this condition have short stature; short fingers; and limited joint movement, especially of the hands. Weill-Marchesani syndrome also causes abnormalities of the lens of the eye that lead to severe nearsightedness, and it can also cause glaucoma. Occasionally patients with this condition have heart defects. In some families this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and caused by mutations in the ADAMTS10 or LTPBP2 genes. Weill-Marchesani syndrome can also have autosomal dominant inheritance, and a FBN1 gene mutation has been found in one family. People with this condition usually need regular eye exams and sometimes need eye surgery.
 Weill-Marchesani syndrome is usually caused by mutations in the ADAMTS10 gene. Two families have been found with mutations in different genes, one with a mutation in FBN1 and one with a mutation in LTBP2.
 The diagnosis of Weill-Marchesani syndrome is made on the presence of the characteristic signs and symptoms. Genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information on the genetic tests available for Weill-Marchesani syndrome. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional.
 There is no cure for Weill-Marchesani syndrome, and treatment focuses addressing the symptoms that develop. Individuals with this condition often need a team of medical specialists, including pediatricians, eye specialists (ophthalmologists and optometrists), orthopedists, and cardiologists. Regular eye exams are important for early diagnosis of eye problems. Corrective glasses, visual aids, or eye surgery may be needed to improve vision. Increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma) may be treated with eye drops, laser therapy, surgical removal of the iris or lens. Contraction or dilation of the pupils can cause glaucoma in some people with Weill-Marchesani syndrome. Medications that contract the pupil must be avoided, and medications that dilate the pupils must be given with care. Joint stiffness and bone abnormalities can cause complications if anesthesia is needed for a procedure. It is important to inform a physician of the diagnosis before receiving anesthesia, as it can impact airway management.
Weill-Marchesani syndrome appears to be rare; it has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 100,000 people.
Mutations in the ADAMTS10 and FBN1 genes can cause Weill-Marchesani syndrome. The ADAMTS10 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. This protein is important for normal growth before and after birth, and it appears to be involved in the development of the eyes, heart, and skeleton. Mutations in this gene disrupt the normal development of these structures, which leads to the specific features of Weill-Marchesani syndrome.  A mutation in the FBN1 gene has also been found to cause Weill-Marchesani syndrome. The FBN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibrillin-1. This protein is needed to form threadlike filaments, called microfibrils, that help provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue. The FBN1 mutation responsible for Weill-Marchesani syndrome leads to an unstable version of fibrillin-1. Researchers believe that the unstable protein interferes with the normal assembly of microfibrils, which weakens connective tissue and causes the abnormalities associated with Weill-Marchesani syndrome.  In some people with Weill-Marchesani syndrome, no mutations in ADAMTS10 or FBN1 have been found. Researchers are looking for other genetic changes that may be responsible for the disorder in these people.
Weill-Marchesani syndrome can be inherited in either an autosomal recessive or an autosomal dominant pattern.  When Weill-Marchesani syndrome is caused by mutations in the ADAMTS10 gene, it has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  Other cases of Weill-Marchesani syndrome, including those caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the genetic change from one parent with the condition.
