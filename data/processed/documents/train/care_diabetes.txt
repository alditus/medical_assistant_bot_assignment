Many people who have diabetes need help paying for their care. For those who qualify, a variety of government and nongovernment programs can help cover health care expenses. This publication is meant to help people with diabetes and their family members find and access such resources.
Health insurance helps pay for medical care, including the cost of diabetes care. Health insurance options include the following:
                
- private health insurance, which includes group and individual health insurance  - government health insurance, such as Medicare, Medicaid, the Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP), TRICARE, and veterans health care programs
                
Starting in 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prevents insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to people with preexisting conditions, such as diabetes. The ACA also requires most people to have health insurance or pay a fee. Some people may be exempt from this fee. Read more about the ACA at HealthCare.gov or call 18003182596, TTY 18558894325.
