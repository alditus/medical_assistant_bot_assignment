Marshall-Smith syndrome is a malformation syndrome characterized by advanced bone age, failure to thrive, respiratory problems, dysmorphic facial features, and variable mental retardation. Less than 40 cases have been reported in the literature, mostly as single case reports or small series. Early death is common due to respiratory complications. The cause of this disease remains unknown, but its sporadic occurrence suggests a de novo (new) dominant mutation. Aggressive management of the early respiratory and feeding problems may improve survival in individuals affected by this condition.
