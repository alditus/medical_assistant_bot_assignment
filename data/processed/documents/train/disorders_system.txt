Your autonomic nervous system is the part of your nervous system that controls involuntary actions, such as the beating of your heart and the widening or narrowing of your blood vessels. When something goes wrong in this system, it can cause serious problems, including       -  Blood pressure problems    -  Heart problems    -  Trouble with breathing and swallowing    -  Erectile dysfunction in men       Autonomic nervous system disorders can occur alone or as the result of another disease, such as Parkinson's disease, alcoholism and diabetes. Problems can affect either part of the system, as in complex regional pain syndromes, or all of the system. Some types are temporary, but many worsen over time. When they affect your breathing or heart function, these disorders can be life-threatening.    Some autonomic nervous system disorders get better when an underlying disease is treated. Often, however, there is no cure. In that case, the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms.     NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
Your immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend against germs. It helps your body to recognize these "foreign" invaders. Then its job is to keep them out, or if it can't, to find and destroy them.    If your immune system cannot do its job, the results can be serious. Disorders of the immune system include       - Allergy and asthma - immune responses to substances that are usually not harmful    - Immune deficiency diseases - disorders in which the immune system is missing one or more of its parts    - Autoimmune diseases - diseases causing your immune system to attack your own body's cells and tissues by mistake       NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
