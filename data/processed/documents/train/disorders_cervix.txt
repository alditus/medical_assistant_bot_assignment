The cervix is the lower part of the uterus, the place where a baby grows during pregnancy. The cervix has a small opening that expands during childbirth. It also allows menstrual blood to leave a woman's body.    Your health care provider may perform a Pap test during your health checkup to look for changes to the cells of the cervix, including cervical cancer. Other problems with the cervix include:       - Cervicitis - inflammation of the cervix. This is usually from an infection.    - Cervical incompetence - This can happen during pregnancy. The opening of the cervix widens long before the baby is due.    - Cervical polyps and cysts - abnormal growths on the cervix
