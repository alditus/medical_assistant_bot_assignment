Osteopathia striata cranial sclerosis is a type of skeletal dysplasia, which refers to a group of genetic conditions that affect the bones and hinder growth and development. The severity of the condition and the associated symptoms vary significantly from person to person, even within a single family. Features of the condition are generally present at birth and may include skeletal abnormalities (particularly at the ends of long bones), sclerosis (hardening) of the craniofacial bones, macrocephaly (unusually large head size), and characteristic facial features. Some affected people may also have developmental delay, hearing loss, heart defects and/or ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the muscles surrounding the eyes). Osteopathia striata cranial sclerosis is caused by changes (mutations) in the WTX gene and is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.
