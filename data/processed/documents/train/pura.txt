PURA syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mild to moderate developmental delay, learning disability, seizures and seizure-like movements, low muscle tone (hypotonia), feeding difficulties, and breathing problems. PURA syndrome occurs when one of a person's two copies of the PURA gene, located on chromosome 5, does not function normally. The reason for this is unknown. Because the features of PURA syndrome are common, a genetic test (such as whole genome sequencing) is needed for diagnosis. Treatment typically includes speech and language support as well as physical and occupational therapy. Early intervention is key.
