Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an inherited condition that is associated with an increased risk of growths along the lining of the gastrointestinal tract (called hamartomatous polyps) and certain types of cancer. Most affected people also have characteristic dark blue to dark brown macules around the mouth, eyes, and nostrils; near the anus (perianal); and on the inside of the cheeks (buccal mucosa). PJS is caused by changes (mutations) in the STK11 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Management typically includes high-risk screening for associated polyps and cancers.
 Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is caused by changes (mutations) in the STK11 gene. STK11 is a tumor suppressor gene which means that it encodes a protein that helps keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in STK11 result in a defective protein that is unable to carry out its normal role. This leads to the development of the polyps and tumors found in PJS. Some people with PJS do not have mutations in the STK11 gene. In these cases, the cause is unknown.
 Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that to be affected, a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A person with PJS has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child.
 Yes, genetic testing is available for STK11, the gene known to cause Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. How is Peutz-Jeghers syndrome diagnosed? A diagnosis of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. In people with a clinical diagnosis of PJS, genetic testing of the STK11 gene confirms the diagnosis in approximately 100% of people who have a positive family history and approximately 90% of people who have no family history of PJS.

The prevalence of this condition is uncertain; estimates range from 1 in 25,000 to 300,000 individuals.
Mutations in the STK11 gene (also known as LKB1) cause most cases of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The STK11 gene is a tumor suppressor gene, which means that it normally prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. A mutation in this gene alters the structure or function of the STK11 protein, disrupting its ability to restrain cell division. The resulting uncontrolled cell growth leads to the formation of noncancerous polyps and cancerous tumors in people with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.  A small percentage of people with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome do not have mutations in the STK11 gene. In these cases, the cause of the disorder is unknown.
