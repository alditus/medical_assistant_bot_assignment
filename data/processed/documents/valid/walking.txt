We walk thousands of steps each day. We walk to do our daily activities, get around, and exercise. Having a problem with walking can make daily life more difficult.     The pattern of how you walk is called your gait. A variety of problems can cause an abnormal gait and lead to problems with walking. These include:        - Injuries, diseases, or abnormal development of the muscles or bones of your legs or feet    - Movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease    - Diseases such as arthritis or multiple sclerosis    - Vision or balance problems       Treatment of walking problems depends on the cause. Physical therapy, surgery, or mobility aids may help.
