                    Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia is a childhood disease in which too many myelocytes and monocytes (immature white blood cells) are made in the bone marrow.
                    Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare childhood cancer that occurs more often in children younger than 2 years. Children who have neurofibromatosis type 1 and males have an increased risk of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.    In JMML, the body tells too many blood stem cells to become two types of white blood cells called myelocytes and monocytes. Some of these blood stem cells never become mature white blood cells. These immature white blood cells are called blasts. Over time, the myelocytes, monocytes, and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.
Signs and symptoms of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia include fever, weight loss, and feeling very tired. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by JMML or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         -  Fever for no known reason.    - Having infections, such as bronchitis or tonsillitis.    - Feeling very tired.    - Easy bruising or bleeding.    - Skin rash.    - Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin.    - Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for JMML depend on the following:         - The age of the child at diagnosis.    - The number of platelets in the blood.    - The amount of a certain type of hemoglobin in red blood cells.
Treatment of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) may include the following:         -  Combination chemotherapy.    -  Stem cell transplant.    -  13-cis-retinoic acid therapy.    - A clinical trial of a new treatment, such as targeted therapy.        Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. For more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.

                    - Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a disease in which too many myelocytes and monocytes (immature white blood cells) are made in the bone marrow.    - Older age and being male increase the risk of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.    - Signs and symptoms of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia include fever, weight loss, and feeling very tired.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a disease in which too many myelocytes and monocytes (immature white blood cells) are made in the bone marrow.
                    In chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), the body tells too many blood stem cells to become two types of white blood cells called myelocytes and monocytes. Some of these blood stem cells never become mature white blood cells. These immature white blood cells are called blasts. Over time, the myelocytes, monocytes, and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.
Older age and being male increase the risk of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Possible risk factors for CMML include the following:         - Older age.    - Being male.    - Being exposed to certain substances at work or in the environment.    - Being exposed to radiation.    - Past treatment with certain anticancer drugs.
Signs and symptoms of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia include fever, weight loss, and feeling very tired. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by CMML or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         -  Fever for no known reason.    - Infection.    - Feeling very tired.    - Weight loss for no known reason.    - Easy bruising or bleeding.    - Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for CMML depend on the following:         - The number of white blood cells or platelets in the blood or bone marrow.    - Whether the patient is anemic.    - The amount of blasts in the blood or bone marrow.    - The amount of hemoglobin in red blood cells.    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes.
Treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) may include the following:         -  Chemotherapy with one or more agents.    -  Stem cell transplant.    - A clinical trial of a new treatment.

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia - Somatic mutation - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.
