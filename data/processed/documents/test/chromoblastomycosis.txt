Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection characterized by raised and crusted lesions which affect the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It most often occurs on the limbs, but can affect any area of the body. Chromoblastomycosis is caused by several fungi found in soil, wood, and decaying plant material. It usually enters the skin through a minor injury such as a splinter. It is most common in areas with tropical and subtropical climates. Treatment of chromoblastomycosis may include medications like itraconazole and flucytosine, cryotherapy, or surgery.
