Wolffian tumors are rare tumors located anywhere along the length between the ovary and vagina in sites of remnant wolffian ducts. Wolffian ducts are structures in a developing embryo that get incorporated into the reproductive system in males and degenerate in females. Wolffian tumors are thought to have a low potential to become cancerous and tend to range from 0.8 to 25 centimeters in size. Surgery is the recommended treatment. In a small number of cases, recurrences or malignancy have been been reported. Close follow-up is advised.
