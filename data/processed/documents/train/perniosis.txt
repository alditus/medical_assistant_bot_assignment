Perniosis are itchy and/or tender red or purple bumps that occur as a reaction to cold. In severe cases, blistering, pustules, scabs and ulceration may also develop. Occasionally, the lesions may be ring-shaped. They may become thickened and persist for months. Perniosis is a form of vasculitis. Signs and symptoms occur hours after cold exposure. Risk factors for perniosis include having poor blood circulation (such as due to diabetes or smoking), a family history of perniosis, poor nutrition, and low body weight. Perniosis may occur alone or in association with an autoimmune condition (e.g., lupus, scleroderma), bone marrow disorder, or cancer. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and prevent infection. Lifestyle/adaptive changes may also be recommended to prevent future symptoms.
