Prurigo nodularis is a skin condition characterized by hard crusty lumps that itch intensely.  The exact cause of the condition is unknown. However, it can occur in isolation or as a result of repeated trauma to chronic pruritus (itching). Treatment for the condition can be challenging.
 Prurigo nodularis can be challenging to treat.  Due to the intensity of the itch patients may go from doctor to doctor without receiving much relief. Treatment may vary from person to person, as no one treatment is always effective at alleviating symptoms. Several treatments may need to be tried.
