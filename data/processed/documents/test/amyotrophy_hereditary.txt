Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy is a type of nervous system disease that affects the brachial plexus. Common signs and symptoms include episodes of severe pain and muscle wasting in one or both shoulders and arms.  Attacks may be spontaneous or triggered (e.g., by exercise, childbirth, surgery, infection etc.).  Secondary complications, such as decreased sensation, abnormal sensations (e.g., numbness and tingling), chronic pain, and impaired movement may develop overtime. Affected members in some families may share additional distinct physical and facial characteristics. Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy can be caused by mutations in the SEPT9 gene.  It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.
The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Arthralgia 90% EMG abnormality 90% Muscle weakness 90% Polyneuropathy 90% Paresthesia 50% Sprengel anomaly 50% Acrocyanosis 7.5% Narrow mouth 7.5% Neurological speech impairment 7.5% Oral cleft 7.5% Respiratory insufficiency 7.5% Round face 7.5% Short stature 7.5% Sleep disturbance 7.5% Hyporeflexia 5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Axonal degeneration - Blepharophimosis - Brachial plexus neuropathy - Cleft palate - Deeply set eye - Depressed nasal bridge - Epicanthus - Facial asymmetry - Hypotelorism - Low-set ears - Peripheral neuropathy - Ptosis - Skeletal muscle atrophy - Upslanted palpebral fissure - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.
Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy is a rare disorder, but its specific prevalence is unknown. Approximately 200 families affected by the disorder have been identified worldwide.
Mutations in the SEPT9 gene cause hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy. The SEPT9 gene provides instructions for making a protein called septin-9, which is part of a group of proteins called septins. Septins are involved in a process called cytokinesis, which is the step in cell division when the fluid inside the cell (cytoplasm) divides to form two separate cells.  The SEPT9 gene seems to be turned on (active) in cells throughout the body. Approximately 15 slightly different versions (isoforms) of the septin-9 protein may be produced from this gene. Some types of cells make certain isoforms, while other cell types produce other isoforms. However, the specific distribution of these isoforms in the body's tissues is not well understood. Septin-9 isoforms interact with other septin proteins to perform some of their functions.  Mutations in the SEPT9 gene may change the sequence of protein building blocks (amino acids) in certain septin-9 isoforms in ways that interfere with their function. These mutations may also change the distribution of septin-9 isoforms and their interactions with other septin proteins in some of the body's tissues. This change in the functioning of septin proteins seems to particularly affect the brachial plexus, but the reason for this is unknown.  Because many of the triggers for hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy also affect the immune system, researchers believe that an autoimmune reaction may be involved in this disorder. However, the relation between SEPT9 mutations and immune function is unclear. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. An autoimmune attack on the nerves in the brachial plexus likely results in the signs and symptoms of hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy.  At least 15 percent of families affected by hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy do not have SEPT9 gene mutations. In these cases, the disorder is believed to be caused by mutations in a gene that has not been identified.
This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.
