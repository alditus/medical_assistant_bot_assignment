Fibromyalgia is a disorder that causes muscle pain and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia have "tender points" on the body. Tender points are specific places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. These points hurt when pressure is put on them.    People with fibromyalgia may also have other symptoms, such as       - Trouble sleeping    - Morning stiffness    - Headaches    - Painful menstrual periods    - Tingling or numbness in hands and feet    - Problems with thinking and memory (sometimes called "fibro fog")       No one knows what causes fibromyalgia. Anyone can get it, but it is most common in middle-aged women. People with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases are particularly likely to develop fibromyalgia. There is no cure for fibromyalgia, but medicine can help you manage your symptoms. Getting enough sleep, exercising, and eating well may also help.
