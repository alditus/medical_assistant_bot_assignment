COACH syndrome is a condition that mainly affects the brain and liver.  Most individuals with COACH syndrome have mental retardation, liver problems (fibrosis), and difficulty with movement (ataxia).  Some may also have an abnormality of the eye (called a coloboma) or abnormal eye movements (such as nystagmus).  This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; 70% of cases are thought to be caused by mutations in the TMEM67 gene.  COACH syndrome is considered a rare form of another condition, Joubert syndrome.
 While there are no official guidelines, a diagnosis of COACH syndrome can be made when an individual is found to have both a particular malformation of the brain called cerebellar vermis hypoplasia (also referred to as the "molar tooth sign" due to the characteristic look of this malformation on brain imaging) and liver disease (specifically fibrosis).
