Gamma heavy chain disease is characterized by the abnormal production of antibodies. Antibodies are made up of light chains and heavy chains. In this disorder, the heavy chain of the gamma antibody (IgG) is overproduced by the body.  Gamma heavy chain disease mainly affects older adults and is similar to aggressive malignant (cancerous) lymphoma. However, some people with this disorder have no symptoms. People with symptoms may respond to chemotherapy drugs, corticosteroids, and radiation therapy. Approximately one-third of individuals with gamma heavy chain disease are also diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder.
 The severity of symptoms varies widely among people with gamma heavy chain disease. Symptoms include, fever, mild anemia, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), recurrent upper respiratory infections, and enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly).
  The causes or risk factors for gamma heavy chain disease are not known.
 People with symptoms may respond to chemotherapy drugs, corticosteroids, and radiation therapy. Commonly used chemotherapeutic agents include cyclophosphamide, prednisone, vincristine, chlorambucil and doxorubicin. Patients are most commonly treated and followed by oncologists and/or hematologists. Additional information about treatment of gamma heavy chain disease can be found through PubMed, a searchable database of biomedical journal articles. Although not all of the articles are available for free online, most articles listed in PubMed have a summary available. To obtain the full article, contact a medical/university library or your local library for interlibrary loan. You can also order articles online through the publisher's Web site.
