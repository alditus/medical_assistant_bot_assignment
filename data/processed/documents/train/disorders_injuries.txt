Your nose is important to your health. It filters the air you breathe, removing dust, germs, and irritants. It warms and moistens the air to keep your lungs and tubes that lead to them from drying out. Your nose also contains the nerve cells that help your sense of smell. When there is a problem with your nose, your whole body can suffer. For example, the stuffy nose of the common cold can make it hard for you to breathe, sleep, or get comfortable.     Many problems besides the common cold can affect the nose. They include       -  Deviated septum - a shifting of the wall that divides the nasal cavity into halves    -  Nasal polyps - soft growths that develop on the lining of your nose or sinuses    -  Nosebleeds     -  Rhinitis - inflammation of the nose and sinuses sometimes caused by allergies. The main symptom is a runny nose.    - Nasal fractures, also known as a broken nose
Your hip is the joint where your thigh bone meets your pelvis bone. Hips are called ball-and-socket joints because the ball-like top of your thigh bone moves within a cup-like space in your pelvis. Your hips are very stable. When they are healthy, it takes great force to hurt them. However, playing sports, running, overuse or falling can all sometimes lead to hip injuries. These include        -  Strains    -  Bursitis    -  Dislocations    -  Fractures       Certain diseases also lead to hip injuries or problems. Osteoarthritis can cause pain and limited motion. Osteoporosis of the hip causes weak bones that break easily. Both of these are common in older people.     Treatment for hip disorders may include rest, medicines, physical therapy, or surgery, including hip replacement.
Heel problems are common and can be painful. Often, they result from too much stress on your heel bone and the tissues that surround it. That stress can come from       - Injuries    - Bruises that you get walking, running or jumping     - Wearing shoes that don't fit or aren't made well    - Being overweight       These can lead to tendinitis, bursitis, and fasciitis, which are all types of inflammation of the tissues that surround your heel. Over time the stress can cause bone spurs and deformities. Certain diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout, can also lead to heel problems. Treatments for heel problems might include rest, medicines, exercises, taping, and special shoes. Surgery is rarely needed.
Any part of your neck - muscles, bones, joints, tendons, ligaments, or nerves - can cause neck problems. Neck pain is very common. Pain may also come from your shoulder, jaw, head, or upper arms.     Muscle strain or tension often causes neck pain. The problem is usually overuse, such as from sitting at a computer for too long. Sometimes you can strain your neck muscles from sleeping in an awkward position or overdoing it during exercise. Falls or accidents, including car accidents, are another common cause of neck pain. Whiplash, a soft tissue injury to the neck, is also called neck sprain or strain.    Treatment depends on the cause, but may include applying ice, taking pain relievers, getting physical therapy or wearing a cervical collar. You rarely need surgery.
Each of your feet has 26 bones, 33 joints, and more than 100 tendons, muscles, and ligaments. No wonder a lot of things can go wrong. Here are a few common problems:       - Bunions - hard, painful bumps on the big toe joint    -  Corns and calluses - thickened skin from friction or pressure    -  Plantar warts - warts on the soles of your feet    -  Fallen arches - also called flat feet        Ill-fitting shoes often cause these problems. Aging and being overweight also increase your chances of having foot problems.
Your backbone, or spine, is made up of 26 bone discs called vertebrae. The vertebrae protect your spinal cord and allow you to stand and bend. A number of problems can change the structure of the spine or damage the vertebrae and surrounding tissue. They include       - Infections    - Injuries    - Tumors    - Conditions, such as ankylosing spondylitis and scoliosis    - Bone changes that come with age, such as spinal stenosis and herniated disks       Spinal diseases often cause pain when bone changes put pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. They can also limit movement. Treatments differ by disease, but sometimes they include back braces and surgery.
No matter how old you are or what you do for a living, you are always using your hands. When there is something wrong with them, you may not be able to do your regular activities.     Hand problems include        -  Carpal tunnel syndrome - compression of a nerve as it goes through the wrist, often making your fingers feel numb     - Injuries that result in fractures, ruptured ligaments and dislocations     -  Osteoarthritis - wear-and-tear arthritis, which can also cause deformity     -  Tendinitis - irritation of the tendons     - Disorders and injuries of your fingers and thumb
Face injuries and disorders can cause pain and affect how you look. In severe cases, they can affect sight, speech, breathing and your ability to swallow. Broken bones, especially the bones of your nose, cheekbone and jaw, are common facial injuries.    Certain diseases also lead to facial disorders. For example, nerve diseases like trigeminal neuralgia or Bell's palsy sometimes cause facial pain, spasms and trouble with eye or facial movement. Birth defects can also affect the face. They can cause underdeveloped or unusually prominent facial features or a lack of facial expression. Cleft lip and palate are a common facial birth defect.
Your jaw is a set of bones that holds your teeth. It consists of two main parts. The upper part is the maxilla. It doesn't move. The moveable lower part is called the mandible. You move it when you talk or chew. The two halves of the mandible meet at your chin. The joint where the mandible meets your skull is the temporomandibular joint.     Jaw problems include       - Fractures    - Dislocations    - Temporomandibular joint dysfunction    - Osteonecrosis, which happens when your bones lose their blood supply    - Cancers       Treatment of jaw problems depends on the cause.
Your knee joint is made up of bone, cartilage, ligaments and fluid. Muscles and tendons help the knee joint move. When any of these structures is hurt or diseased, you have knee problems. Knee problems can cause pain and difficulty walking.    Knee problems are very common, and they occur in people of all ages. Knee problems can interfere with many things, from participation in sports to simply getting up from a chair and walking. This can have a big impact on your life.    The most common disease affecting the knee is osteoarthritis. The cartilage in the knee gradually wears away, causing pain and swelling.    Injuries to ligaments and tendons also cause knee problems. A common injury is to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). You usually injure your ACL by a sudden twisting motion. ACL and other knee injuries are common sports injuries.    Treatment of knee problems depends on the cause. In some cases your doctor may recommend knee replacement.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
