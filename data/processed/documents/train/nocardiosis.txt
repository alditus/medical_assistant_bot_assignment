Nocardiosis is a rare disorder that affects the brain, skin, and/or lungs. It occurs mainly in people with a weakened immune system. This condition usually starts in the lungs and can spread to other body organs. Affected individuals usually experience problems with their lungs (chest pain, coughing up blood, fevers), brain (headaches and seizures), and skin (skin infections, ulcers, and abscesses). The nocardia bacteria are found in soil around the world. People contract this disease by either inhaling contaminated dust or if soil containing nocardia bacteria get into an open wound. While anyone can contract this condition, people with a weakened immune system or chronic lung disease are at greatest risk of this condition.
The bacteria that cause nocardiosis are commonly found in soil and water.
    
You could become sick with nocardiosis if:
    
     - You inhale (breathe in) the bacteria
     - Bacteria gets into an open wound or cut
    
    
In rare cases, infection can occur during surgical procedures.
    
Fortunately, nocardiosis is not spread person to person, so being around someone who has the disease will not make you sick.
The symptoms of nocardiosis vary depending on which part of your body is affected.
    
Nocardiosis infection most commonly occurs in the lung. If your lungs are infected, you can experience:
    
     - Fever
     - Weight loss
     - Night sweats
     - Cough
     - Chest pain
     - Pneumonia
    
    
When lung infections occur, the infection commonly spreads to the brain. If your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) is infected, you can experience:
    
     - Headache
     - Weakness
     - Confusion
     - Seizures (sudden, abnormal electrical activity in the brain)
    
    
Skin infections can occur when open wounds or cuts come into contact with contaminated soil. If your skin is affected, you can experience:
    
     - Ulcers
     - Nodules sometimes draining and spreading along lymph nodes
If you think you might be sick with nocardiosis, talk to your doctor.
    
He or she can help find out if you have the disease by performing tests that can identify the bacteria that causes nocardiosis.
    
Testing may involve taking tissue samples from the part of the body that is infected. Tissue samples may include the:
    
     - Brain
     - Skin
     - Lungs (or other parts of the lower airways)
     - Mucus from the lower airways
