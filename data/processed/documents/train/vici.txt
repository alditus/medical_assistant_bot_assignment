Vici syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized by agenesis (failure to develop) of the corpus callosum, cataracts , hypopigmentation of the eyes and hair, cardiomyopathy, and combined immunodeficiency. Hearing loss, seizures, and delayed motor development have also been reported. Swallowing and feeding difficulties early on may result in a failure to thrive. Recurrent infections of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts are common. Vici syndrome is caused by mutations in the EPG5 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is mainly supportive.
