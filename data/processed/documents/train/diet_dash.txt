Summary : DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. It is an eating plan that is based on research studies sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). These studies showed that DASH lowers high blood pressure and improves levels of cholesterol. This reduces your risk of getting heart disease.    The DASH Diet       - Emphasizes vegetables, fruits, and fat-free or low-fat dairy products.    - Includes whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, seeds, nuts, and vegetable oils.    - Limits sodium, sweets, sugary beverages, and red meats.       Along with DASH, other lifestyle changes can help lower your blood pressure. They include staying at a healthy weight, exercising, and not smoking.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
