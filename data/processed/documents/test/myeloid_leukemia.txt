Smoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation may affect the risk of adult AML. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Possible risk factors for AML include the following:         - Being male.    - Smoking, especially after age 60.    - Having had treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the past.    - Having had treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the past.    - Being exposed to radiation from an atomic bomb or to the chemical benzene.    - Having a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome.
Signs and symptoms of adult AML include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding. The early signs and symptoms of AML may be like those caused by the flu or other common diseases. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         -  Fever.    - Shortness of breath.    - Easy bruising or bleeding.    -  Petechiae (flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding).    - Weakness or feeling tired.    - Weight loss or loss of appetite.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on:         - The age of the patient.    - The subtype of AML.    - Whether the patient received chemotherapy in the past to treat a different cancer.    - Whether there is a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome.    - Whether the cancer has spread to the central nervous system.    - Whether the cancer has been treated before or recurred (come back).         It is important that acute leukemia be treated right away.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
				                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of adult AML.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.
				                
				                
				                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
				                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
				                
				                
				                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
				                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.

The risk factors for childhood AML, childhood CML, JMML, and MDS are similar. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk. These and other factors may increase the risk of childhood AML, childhood CML, JMML, and MDS:         - Having a brother or sister, especially a twin, with leukemia.    - Being Hispanic.    - Being exposed to cigarette smoke or alcohol before birth.     - Having a personal history of aplastic anemia.    - Having a personal or family history of MDS.    - Having a family history of AML.    - Past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.    - Being exposed to ionizing radiation or chemicals such as benzene.    - Having certain genetic disorders, such as:               - Down syndrome.      -  Fanconi anemia.      -  Neurofibromatosis type 1.      -  Noonan syndrome.      -  Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.
Signs and symptoms of childhood AML, childhood CML, JMML, or MDS include fever, feeling tired, and easy bleeding or bruising. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood AML, childhood CML, JMML, or MDS or by other conditions. Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following:         -  Fever with or without an infection.    - Night sweats.    - Shortness of breath.    - Weakness or feeling tired.    - Easy bruising or bleeding.    -  Petechiae (flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding).    - Pain in the bones or joints.    - Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs.    - Painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, groin, or other parts of the body. In childhood AML, these lumps, called leukemia cutis, may be blue or purple.    - Painless lumps that are sometimes around the eyes. These lumps, called chloromas, are sometimes seen in childhood AML and may be blue-green.    - An eczema -like skin rash.        The signs and symptoms of TMD may include the following:         - Swelling all over the body.    - Shortness of breath.    - Trouble breathing.    - Weakness or feeling tired.    - Pain below the ribs.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for childhood AML depend on the following:         - The age of the child when the cancer is diagnosed.    - The race or ethnic group of the child.    - Whether the child is greatly overweight.    -  Number of white blood cells in the blood at diagnosis.    - Whether the AML occurred after previous cancer treatment.    - The subtype of AML.    - Whether there are certain chromosome or gene changes in the leukemia cells.    - Whether the child has Down syndrome. Most children with AML and Down syndrome can be cured of their leukemia.    - Whether the leukemia is in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).    - How quickly the leukemia responds to treatment.    - Whether the AML is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has recurred (come back) after being treated.    - The length of time since treatment ended, for AML that has recurred.        The prognosis and treatment options for childhood CML depend on how long it has been since the patient was diagnosed and how many blast cells are in the blood.   The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for JMML depend on the following:         - The age of the child when the cancer is diagnosed.    - The type of gene affected and the number of genes that have changes.    - How many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are in the blood.    - Whether the JMML is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has recurred after treatment.        The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for MDS depend on the following:         - Whether the MDS was caused by previous cancer treatment.    - How low the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are.    - Whether the MDS is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has recurred after treatment.

Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.     Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of biologic therapy. NK cells are white blood cells that can kill tumor cells. These may be taken from a donor and given to the patient by infusion to help kill leukemia cells.

Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia, however, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, making it hard for blood to do its work. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), there are too many of a specific type of white blood cell called a myeloblast.    AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. Possible risk factors include smoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation.     Symptoms of AML include:       - Fever    - Shortness of breath    - Easy bruising or bleeding    - Bleeding under the skin    - Weakness or feeling tired    - Weight loss or loss of appetite       Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow diagnose AML. Treatments include chemotherapy, other drugs, radiation therapy, stem cell transplants, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. Once the leukemia is in remission, you need additional treatment to make sure that it does not come back.    NIH: National Cancer Institute
Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, making it hard for blood to do its work. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), there are too many granulocytes, a type of white blood cell.    Most people with CML have a gene mutation (change) called the Philadelphia chromosome.    Sometimes CML does not cause any symptoms. If you have symptoms, they may include:       - Fatigue    - Weight loss    - Night sweats    - Fever    - Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side       Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow diagnose CML. Treatments include chemotherapy, stem cell transplants, infusion of donated white blood cells following stem cell transplants, surgery to remove the spleen, and biologic and targeted therapies. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.    NIH: National Cancer Institute
 The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Chronic myeloid leukemia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Chronic myelogenous leukemia - Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia - Somatic mutation - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.
