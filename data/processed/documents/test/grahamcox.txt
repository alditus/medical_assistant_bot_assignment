 The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Graham-Cox syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cognitive impairment 90% Conductive hearing impairment 90% High forehead 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Macrocephaly 90% Nystagmus 90% Pectus excavatum 90% Scoliosis 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Short neck 90% Short stature 90% Choanal atresia 50% Cleft palate 50% Iris coloboma 50% Patent ductus arteriosus 50% Prominent nasal bridge 50% Ventricular septal defect 50% Agenesis of corpus callosum - Broad neck - Cupped ear - High palate - Intellectual disability - Low-set ears - Optic nerve coloboma - Retrognathia - Visual impairment - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.
