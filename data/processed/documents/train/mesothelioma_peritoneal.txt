The tissue that lines your lungs, stomach, heart, and other organs is called mesothelium. Mesothelioma is a tumor of that tissue. It usually starts in the lungs, but can also start in the abdomen or other organs. It can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer.)    Malignant mesothelioma is a rare but serious type of cancer. Most people who get it have worked on jobs where they inhaled asbestos particles. After being exposed to asbestos, it usually takes a long time for the disease to form.    Symptoms include       - Trouble breathing    - Pain under the rib cage    - Pain, swelling, or lumps in the abdomen    - Weight loss for no known reason       Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer. Your doctor uses imaging tests and a biopsy to make the diagnosis. Malignant mesothelioma is often found when it is advanced. This makes it harder to treat. Treatment may include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy.    NIH: National Cancer Institute
Benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma (BMPM) is a very rare benign cystic tumor arising from the peritoneal mesothelium (lining of the abdominal wall). It commonly occurs in young to middle-aged women who have a prior history of abdominal surgery, endometriosis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. The first symptoms usually include abdominal or pelvic pain, tenderness, and rarely, constipation and/or urinary hesitancy. Since it was first described in 1979, there have been approximately 130 cases described in the medical literature. BMPM is not related to prior asbestos exposure. The specific cause is unknown.
 Surgery to remove the cystic lesions is the only effective treatment for BMPM. Aggressive surgical approaches are often recommended. Hormonal therapy has also been attempted in individual cases with variable degrees of success. Most affected individuals do not undergo chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy because these tumors are usually benign.
