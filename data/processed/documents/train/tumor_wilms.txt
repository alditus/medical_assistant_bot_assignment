Signs of Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors include a lump in the abdomen and blood in the urine. Sometimes childhood kidney tumors do not cause signs and symptoms and the parent finds a mass in the abdomen by chance or the mass is found during a well-child health check up. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by kidney tumors or by other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:         - A lump, swelling, or pain in the abdomen.    - Blood in the urine.     -  High blood pressure (headache, feeling very tired, chest pain, or trouble seeing or breathing).    -  Hypercalcemia (loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, weakness, or feeling very tired).    -  Fever for no known reason.    - Loss of appetite.    - Weight loss for no known reason.        Wilms tumor that has spread to the lungs or liver may cause the following signs and symptoms:         - Cough.    - Blood in the sputum.    - Trouble breathing.    - Pain in the abdomen.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for Wilms tumor depend on the following:         - How different the tumor cells are from normal kidney cells when looked at under a microscope.    - The stage of the cancer.    - The type of tumor.    - The age of the child.    - Whether the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.    - Whether there are certain changes in chromosomes or genes.    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).        The prognosis for renal cell cancer depends on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    - Whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.        The prognosis for rhabdoid tumor of the kidney depends on the following:         - The age of the child at the time of diagnosis.    - The stage of the cancer.    - Whether the cancer has spread to the brain or spinal cord.        The prognosis for clear cell sarcoma of the kidney depends on the following:         - The age of the child at the time of diagnosis.    - The stage of the cancer.
Wilms tumor is a rare type of kidney cancer. It causes a tumor on one or both kidneys. It usually affects children, but can happen in adults. Having certain genetic conditions or birth defects can increase the risk of getting it. Children that are at risk should be screened for Wilms tumor every three months until they turn eight.    Symptoms include a lump in the abdomen, blood in the urine, and a fever for no reason. Tests that examine the kidney and blood are used to find the tumor.    Doctors usually diagnose and remove the tumor in surgery. Other treatments include chemotherapy and radiation and biologic therapies. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer.    NIH: National Cancer Institute
