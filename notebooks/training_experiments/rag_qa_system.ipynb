There are different types of glaucoma, but they can all lead to vision loss and blindness if not treated. Some key facts about glaucoma:\\n\\n- It is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. \\n\\n- There are often no early symptoms. Vision loss starts with peripheral vision and can occur gradually.\\n\\n- Risk factors include older age, family history, high eye pressure, and certain medical conditions like diabetes.\\n\\n- Treatment focuses on lowering eye pressure through eye drops, pills, laser procedures, or surgery. Early detection and treatment are key to preventing vision loss.\\n\\n- Glaucoma cannot be cured, but early treatment helps slow or prevent further vision loss. Regular eye exams are important, especially for those at higher risk.\\n\\nThe context provided does not contain information specifically about glaucoma. However, I have provided a general overview of this common eye disease based on my knowledge. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!'"

It is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene and usually affects young children. Key features of retinoblastoma include:\\n\\n- It develops in one or both eyes, usually before age 5.\\n\\n- Common signs are a white pupil, crossed eyes, poor vision or red and swollen eyes.\\n\\n- Treatment involves surgery, radiation, laser therapy, freezing (cryotherapy), or chemotherapy. \\n\\n- If caught early, retinoblastoma has a high cure rate, though vision loss can occur. Untreated, it can spread to other parts of the body.\\n\\n- It can be inherited (due to RB1 gene mutation) or non-inherited (somatic mutation). The inherited form tends to be bilateral and diagnosed earlier.\\n\\nSo in summary, retinoblastoma is a rare pediatric eye cancer arising from retinal cells, often due to RB1 gene mutations.
