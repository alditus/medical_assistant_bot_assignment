Heart diseases that affect women more than men include       - Coronary microvascular disease (MVD) - a problem that affects the heart's tiny arteries    - Broken heart syndrome - extreme emotional stress leading to severe but often short-term heart muscle failure       The older a woman gets, the more likely she is to get heart disease.
