Familial amyloidosis, Finnish type, or gelsolin amyloidosis, is a condition characterized by abnormal deposits of amyloid protein that mainly affect the eyes, nerves and skin. The 3 main features are amyloid deposits in the cornea (corneal lattice dystrophy), bilateral facial paralysis, and cutis laxa ("sagging" skin). Symptoms generally worsen with age. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is caused by mutations in the GSN gene. Treatment generally focuses on specific signs and symptoms. Plastic surgery may relieve problems caused by facial paralysis and cutis laxa.
