Dengue is an infection caused by a virus. You can get it if an infected mosquito bites you. Dengue does not spread from person to person. It is common in warm, wet areas of the world. Outbreaks occur in the rainy season. Dengue is rare in the United States.     Symptoms include a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and a rash. In some cases, dengue turns into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which causes bleeding from your nose, gums, or under your skin. It can also become dengue shock syndrome, which causes massive bleeding and shock. These forms of dengue are life-threatening.    There is no specific treatment. Most people with dengue recover within 2 weeks. Until then, drinking lots of fluids, resting and taking non-aspirin fever-reducing medicines might help. People with the more severe forms of dengue usually need to go to the hospital and get fluids.    To lower your risk when traveling to areas where dengue is found       - Wear insect repellent with DEET     - Wear clothes that cover your arms, legs and feet     - Close unscreened doors and windows        NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
 The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Dengue fever. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of temperature regulation 90% Migraine 90% Abdominal pain 50% Arthralgia 50% Pruritus 50% Skin rash 50% Ascites 7.5% Bruising susceptibility 7.5% Diarrhea 7.5% Epistaxis 7.5% Gastrointestinal hemorrhage 7.5% Gingival bleeding 7.5% Hepatomegaly 7.5% Hypoproteinemia 7.5% Hypotension 7.5% Intracranial hemorrhage 7.5% Leukopenia 7.5% Nausea and vomiting 7.5% Reduced consciousness/confusion 7.5% Sudden cardiac death 7.5% Thrombocytopenia 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.
