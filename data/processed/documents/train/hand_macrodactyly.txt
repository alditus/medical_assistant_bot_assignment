Macrodactyly of the hand is a rare condition in which a person's fingers are abnormally large due to the overgrowth of the underlying bone and soft tissue. This condition is congenital, meaning that babies are born with it. Although babies are born with the condition, macrodactyly is usually not inherited. Most of the time, only one hand is affected, but usually more than one finger is involved. Macrodactyly may also coexist with syndactyly, a condition in which two fingers are fused together. Although it is a benign condition, macrodactyly is deforming and can look cosmetically displeasing. Surgery, usually involving multiple procedures, can help the problem.
