Juvenile arthritis (JA) is arthritis that happens in children. It causes joint swelling, pain, stiffness, and loss of motion. It can affect any joint, but is more common in the knees, hands, and feet. In some cases it can affect internal organs as well.    The most common type of JA that children get is juvenile idiopathic arthritis. There are several other forms of arthritis affecting children.    One early sign of JA may be limping in the morning. Symptoms can come and go. Some children have just one or two flare-ups. Others have symptoms that never go away. JA can cause growth problems and eye inflammation in some children.    No one knows exactly what causes JA. Most types are autoimmune disorders. This means that your immune system, which normally helps your body fight infection, attacks your body's own tissues.    JA can be hard to diagnose. Your health care provider may do a physical exam, lab tests, and x-rays. A team of providers usually treats JA. Medicines and physical therapy can help maintain movement and reduce swelling and pain. They may also help prevent and treat complications.

Psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that is characterized by both arthritis and psoriasis. Other signs and symptoms may include dactylitis (inflammation and swelling of an entire finger or toe); nail pitting or splitting; and eye problems. Although the underlying cause of psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is currently unknown (idiopathic), it is thought to occur due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is very rare for more than one member of a family to have juvenile arthritis; however, research suggests that having a family member with juvenile arthritis or any autoimmune disease may increase the risk of having juvenile arthritis, in general. Treatment usually involves different types of medications to help manage symptoms and/or physical therapy.
The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Juvenile idiopathic arthritis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of temperature regulation 90% Arthralgia 90% Arthritis 90% Autoimmunity 90% Joint swelling 90% Skin rash 90% Mediastinal lymphadenopathy 50% Abdominal pain 7.5% Abnormality of the pericardium 7.5% Abnormality of the pleura 7.5% Hepatomegaly 7.5% Splenomegaly 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.
Enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that is characterized by both arthritis and inflammation of an enthesitis site (the point at which a ligament, tendon, or joint capsule attaches to the bone). Signs and symptoms generally develop in late childhood or early adolescence and include pain, tenderness, and swelling in joints and at the enthesis. The knee and the back of the ankle (at the Achilles tendon) are the most commonly affected parts of the body. The underlying cause of enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis is currently unknown (idiopathic). It is very rare for more than one member of a family to have juvenile arthritis; however, research suggests that having a family member with juvenile arthritis or any autoimmune disease may increase the risk of having juvenile arthritis, in general. Treatment usually involves different types of medications to help manage symptoms and/or physical therapy.

The incidence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in North America and Europe is estimated to be 4 to 16 in 10,000 children. One in 1,000, or approximately 294,000, children in the United States are affected. The most common type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the United States is oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which accounts for about half of all cases. For reasons that are unclear, females seem to be affected with juvenile idiopathic arthritis somewhat more frequently than males. However, in enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis males are affected more often than females. The incidence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis varies across different populations and ethnic groups.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The term "idiopathic" indicates that the specific cause of the disorder is unknown. Its signs and symptoms result from excessive inflammation in and around the joints. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. Normally, the body stops the inflammatory response after healing is complete to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues. In people with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, the inflammatory response is prolonged, particularly during movement of the joints. The reasons for this excessive inflammatory response are unclear.  Researchers have identified changes in several genes that may influence the risk of developing juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Many of these genes belong to a family of genes that provide instructions for making a group of related proteins called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. Certain normal variations of several HLA genes seem to affect the risk of developing juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and the specific type of the condition that a person may have.  Normal variations in several other genes have also been associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Many of these genes are thought to play roles in immune system function. Additional unknown genetic influences and environmental factors, such as infection and other issues that affect immune health, are also likely to influence a person's chances of developing this complex disorder.
Most cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A small percentage of cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis have been reported to run in families, although the inheritance pattern of the condition is unclear. A sibling of a person with juvenile idiopathic arthritis has an estimated risk of developing the condition that is about 12 times that of the general population.
