 The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Feingold syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Blepharophimosis 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 90% Microcephaly 90% 4-5 toe syndactyly 86% 2-3 toe syndactyly 56% Anteverted nares 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Depressed nasal bridge 50% External ear malformation 50% Hallux valgus 50% Short stature 50% Toe syndactyly 50% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 7.5% Abnormality of the spleen 7.5% Annular pancreas 7.5% Duodenal stenosis 7.5% Oral cleft 7.5% Patent ductus arteriosus 7.5% Sensorineural hearing impairment 7.5% Tracheoesophageal fistula 7.5% Accessory spleen - Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of the 2nd finger - Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of the 5th finger - Asplenia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Decreased fetal movement - Depressed nasal tip - Duodenal atresia - Epicanthus - Esophageal atresia - Facial asymmetry - Hearing impairment - High palate - Intellectual disability - Low-set ears - Polyhydramnios - Polysplenia - Posteriorly rotated ears - Prominent occiput - Short palpebral fissure - Short toe - Small anterior fontanelle - Specific learning disability - Thick vermilion border - Triangular face - Upslanted palpebral fissure - Vocal cord paralysis - Wide nasal bridge - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.
Feingold syndrome is a disorder that affects many parts of the body. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary among affected individuals, even among members of the same family.  Individuals with Feingold syndrome have characteristic abnormalities of their fingers and toes. Almost all people with this condition have a specific hand abnormality called brachymesophalangy, which refers to shortening of the second and fifth fingers. Other common abnormalities include fifth fingers that curve inward (clinodactyly), underdeveloped thumbs (thumb hypoplasia), and fusion (syndactyly) of the second and third toes or the fourth and fifth toes.  People with Feingold syndrome are frequently born with a blockage in part of their digestive system called gastrointestinal atresia. In most cases, the blockage occurs in the esophagus (esophageal atresia) or in part of the small intestine (duodenal atresia). Additional common features of Feingold syndrome include an unusually small head size (microcephaly), a small jaw (micrognathia), a narrow opening of the eyelids (short palpebral fissures), and mild to moderate learning disability. Less often, affected individuals have hearing loss, impaired growth, and kidney and heart abnormalities.
Feingold syndrome appears to be a rare condition, although its exact prevalence is unknown.
Mutations in the MYCN gene cause Feingold syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. Studies in animals suggest that this protein is necessary for normal development of the limbs, heart, kidneys, nervous system, digestive system, and lungs. The MYCN protein regulates the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA. On the basis of this action, this protein is called a transcription factor.  Mutations in the MYCN gene that cause Feingold syndrome prevent one copy of the gene in each cell from producing any functional MYCN protein. As a result, only half the normal amount of this protein is available to control the activity of specific genes during embryonic development. It remains unclear how a reduced amount of the MYCN protein causes the specific features of Feingold syndrome.
This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.
