La Crosse (LAC) encephalitis is a mosquito-borne virus that was first described in La Crosse, Wisconsin in 1963. Since then, it has been reported in several Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic states. The LAC virus is one of many mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause an inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). About 80-100 cases of this condition are reported each year in the United States. Most cases occur in children younger than age 16. While most people who become infected have no symptoms, those who do become ill may have fever, headache, vomiting and lethargy (tiredness). Severe cases develop encephalitis accompanied by seizures. Coma and paralysis occur in some cases. There is no specific treatment for LAC encephalitis. Supportive therapy is provided to those who develop severe cases of the disease.
 Most people infected with LAC encephalitis do not have symptoms. Those that do become ill may initially have fever, headache, vomiting and lethargy (tiredness). Severe cases may develop encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, which is often accompanied by seizures. Coma and paralysis may also occur. Most cases that develop symptoms occur in children under the age of 16 Symptoms, if present, typically develop 5 to 15 days after the bite of an infected mosquito. Most cases occur during the summer months.
 There is no specific treatment for LAC encephalitis. Severe cases are treated with supportive therapy which may include hospitalization, respiratory support, IV fluids and prevention of other infections.[9633]
There is no vaccine against La Crosse encephalitis virus (LACV). Reducing exposure to mosquito bites is the best defense against getting infected with LACV or other mosquito-borne viruses. There are several approaches you and your family can use to prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases. 
 
 - Use repellent: When outdoors, use insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin as well as on clothing (mosquitoes will bite through thin cloth). 
   
   - Permethrin is a repellent/insecticide that can be applied to clothing and will provide excellent protection through multiple washes. You can treat clothing yourself (always follow the directions on the package!) or purchase pre-treated clothing. For best protection it is still necessary to apply other repellent to exposed skin.  
    
 - Wear protective clothing: Wear long sleeves, pants and socks when weather permits. 
 - Avoid peak biting hours: Avoid outdoor activity or use protective measures when mosquitoes are active (Aedes triseriatus mosquitoes are most active during daytimeâ€”from dawn until dusk). 
 - Install and repair screens: Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.  
 - Keep mosquitoes from laying eggs near you: Mosquitoes can lay eggs even in small amounts of standing water. While Aedes triseriatus prefers treeholes, it will also lay eggs in artificial containers. You can fill treeholes in/around your yard with soil. Get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets, barrels, and tires. Change the water in pet dishes and replace the water in bird baths weekly. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out. Empty children's wading pools and store on their side after use.
