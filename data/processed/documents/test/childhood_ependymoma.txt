The cause of most childhood brain tumors is unknown.
The signs and symptoms of childhood ependymoma are not the same in every child. Signs and symptoms depend on the following:         - The child's age.    - Where the tumor has formed.        Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood ependymoma or by other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:         - Frequent headaches.    -  Seizures.    - Nausea and vomiting.    - Pain or stiffness in the neck.    - Loss of balance or trouble walking.    - Weakness in the legs.    - Blurry vision.    - Back pain.    - A change in bowel function.    - Trouble urinating.    -  Confusion or irritability.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on:         - Where the tumor has formed in the central nervous system (CNS).    - Whether there are certain changes in the genes or chromosomes.    - Whether any cancer cells remain after surgery to remove the tumor.     - The type of ependymoma.     - The age of the child when the tumor is diagnosed.     - Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the brain or spinal cord.     - Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).         Prognosis also depends on the type and dose of radiation therapy that is given.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                  
                 
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
Key Points
                    - The area where the tumor is found and the childs age are used in place of a staging system to plan cancer treatment.    - The information from tests and procedures done to detect (find) childhood ependymoma is used to plan cancer treatment.
                
                
                    The area where the tumor is found and the childs age are used in place of a staging system to plan cancer treatment.
                    Staging is the process used to find out how much cancer there is and if cancer has spread. There is no standard staging system for childhood ependymoma. Treatment is based on where the cancer is in the body and the age of the child.
                
                
                    The information from tests and procedures done to detect (find) childhood ependymoma is used to plan cancer treatment.
                    Some of the tests used to detect childhood ependymoma are repeated after the tumor is removed by surgery. (See the General Information section.) This is to find out how much tumor remains after surgery.
