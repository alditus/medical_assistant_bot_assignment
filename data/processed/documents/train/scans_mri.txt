Summary : Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a large magnet and radio waves to look at organs and structures inside your body. Health care professionals use MRI scans to diagnose a variety of conditions, from torn ligaments to tumors. MRIs are very useful for examining the brain and spinal cord.     During the scan, you lie on a table that slides inside a tunnel-shaped machine. Doing the scan can take a long time, and you must stay still. The scan is painless. The MRI machine makes a lot of noise. The technician may offer you earplugs.    Before you get a scan, tell your doctor if you        - Are pregnant     - Have pieces of metal in your body. You might have metal in your body if you have a shrapnel or bullet injury or if you are a welder.    - Have metal or electronic devices in your body, such as a cardiac pacemaker or a metal artificial joint
Summary : Computed tomography (CT) is a type of imaging. It uses special x-ray equipment to make cross-sectional pictures of your body.     Doctors use CT scans to look for       -  Broken bones    -  Cancers    -  Blood clots    -  Signs of heart disease    -  Internal bleeding       During a CT scan, you lie still on a table. The table slowly passes through the center of a large X-ray machine. The test is painless. During some tests you receive a contrast dye, which makes parts of your body show up better in the image.

Summary : Nuclear scans use radioactive substances to see structures and functions inside your body. They use a special camera that detects radioactivity.    Before the test, you receive a small amount of radioactive material. You may get it as an injection. Sometimes you swallow it or inhale it. Then you lie still on a table while the camera makes images. Most scans take 20 to 45 minutes.    Nuclear scans can help doctors diagnose many conditions, including cancers, injuries, and infections. They can also show how organs like your heart and lungs are working.
