Signs of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma include breathing problems and swollen lymph nodes. These and other signs may be caused by childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions. Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following:         - Trouble breathing.    - Wheezing.    - Coughing.    -  High-pitched breathing sounds.    - Swelling of the head, neck, upper body, or arms.    - Trouble swallowing.    - Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin.    - Painless lump or swelling in a testicle.     -  Fever for no known reason.    - Weight loss for no known reason.    - Night sweats.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on:         - The type of lymphoma.    - Where the tumor is in the body when the tumor is diagnosed.    - The stage of the cancer.    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes.    - The type of initial treatment.    - Whether the lymphoma responded to initial treatment.    - The patients age and general health.
Age, gender, and a weakened immune system can affect the risk of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.    These and other risk factors may increase the risk of certain types of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma:         - Being older, male, or white.    - Having one of the following medical conditions:               - An inherited immune disorder (such as hypogammaglobulinemia or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome).      - An autoimmune disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or Sjgren syndrome).      - HIV/AIDS.      - Human T-lymphotrophic virus type I or Epstein-Barr virus infection.      - Helicobacter pylori infection.             - Taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant.
Signs and symptoms of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma include swelling in the lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. These signs and symptoms may be caused by adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - Swelling in the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, groin, or stomach.    - Fever for no known reason.    - Recurring night sweats.    - Feeling very tired.    - Weight loss for no known reason.    - Skin rash or itchy skin.    - Pain in the chest, abdomen, or bones for no known reason.        When fever, night sweats, and weight loss occur together, this group of symptoms is called B symptoms.    Other signs and symptoms of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma may occur and depend on the following:          - Where the cancer forms in the body.    - The size of the tumor.    - How fast the tumor grows.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    - The type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.     - The amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood.    - Whether there are certain changes in the genes.    - The patients age and general health.    - Whether the lymphoma has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).        For non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy, the treatment options also depend on:         - The wishes of the patient.    - Which trimester of pregnancy the patient is in.    - Whether the baby can be delivered early.        Some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma spread more quickly than others do. Most non-Hodgkin lymphomas that occur during pregnancy are aggressive. Delaying treatment of aggressive lymphoma until after the baby is born may lessen the mother's chance of survival. Immediate treatment is often recommended, even during pregnancy.
