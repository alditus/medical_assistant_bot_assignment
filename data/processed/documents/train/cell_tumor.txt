Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors are cancerous tumors commonly found in the pineal gland in the brain, in the mediastinum, or in the abdomen. They originate from cells that were meant to form sex cells (i.e., sperm or eggs). They are often large and have a tendency to spread more quickly than the other type of germ cell tumor (i.e., seminoma type). Possible early signs of this cancer include chest pain and breathing problems.
