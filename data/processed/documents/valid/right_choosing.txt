If you have advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), you may soon need treatment to do the work your kidneys can no longer do. Learning about your treatment options for kidney failure will help you make the best choice for you. Each treatment has pros and cons. Your choice of treatment will have a big effect on your daily life, such as continuing to work if you do so currently. Talking with your doctor ahead of time about your options can help you take control of your care. Understanding the treatment you choose and getting used to the idea that you need to have this treatment takes time. If you find your choice of treatment does not fit your lifestyle, talk with your doctor about picking another treatment that fits your needs better.
The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through two thin tubes of muscle called ureters, one on each side of the bladder. The bladder stores urine. The muscles of the bladder wall remain relaxed while the bladder fills with urine. As the bladder fills to capacity, signals sent to the brain tell a person to find a toilet soon. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder. In men the urethra is long, while in women it is short.
- You have three treatment options to choose from to filter your blood. A fourth option offers care without replacing the work of the kidneys.      - Hemodialysis    - Peritoneal dialysis    - Kidney transplantation    - Conservative management    - None of these treatments helps the kidneys get better. However, they all can help you feel better.  - Hemodialysis uses a machine to move your blood through a filter outside your body, removing wastes.  - Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your belly to filter your blood inside your body, removing wastes.  - Kidney transplantation is surgery to place a healthy kidney from a person who has just died or a living person, usually a family member, into your body to take over the job of filtering your blood.  - Conservative management is the choice not to treat kidney failure with dialysis or a transplant.  - All of the treatment options for kidney failure require changes and restrictions in your diet.
