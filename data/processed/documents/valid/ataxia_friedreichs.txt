Friedreich's ataxia is an inherited disease that damages your nervous system. The damage affects your spinal cord and the nerves that control muscle movement in your arms and legs. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 15. The main symptom is ataxia, which means trouble coordinating movements. Specific symptoms include       - Difficulty walking    -  Muscle weakness    -  Speech problems    -  Involuntary eye movements    -  Scoliosis (curving of the spine to one side)    -  Heart palpitations, from the heart disease which can happen along with Friedreich's ataxia       People with Friedreich's ataxia usually need a wheelchair 15 to 20 years after symptoms first appear. In severe cases, people become incapacitated. There is no cure. You can treat symptoms with medicines, braces, surgery, and physical therapy.

There is currently no effective cure or treatment for Friedreich's ataxia. However, many of the symptoms and accompanying complications can be treated to help individuals maintain optimal functioning as long as possible. Diabetes and heart problems can be treated with medications. Orthopedic problems such as foot deformities and scoliosis can be treated with braces or surgery. Physical therapy may prolong use of the arms and legs.
Generally, within 15 to 20 years after the appearance of the first symptoms, the person is confined to a wheelchair, and in later stages of the disease, individuals may become completely incapacitated. Friedreich's ataxia can shorten life expectancy; heart disease is the most common cause of death. Many individuals with Friedreich's ataxia die in early adulthood, but some people with less severe symptoms live into their 60s, 70s, or longer.
Friedreich's ataxia is caused by a mutation in the protein frataxin, which is involved in the function of mitochondriathe energy producing power plants of the cell. Frataxin controls important steps in mitochondrial iron metabolism and overall cell iron stability.NINDS-funded researchers are studying the metabolic functions of mitochondria in individuals with Friedreichs ataxia. Ongoing research is aimed at understanding the molecular basis for and mechanisms involved in the inactivation of the gene that provides instructions for frataxin, which could lead to potential ways to reverse the silencing and restore normal gene function.And researchers are using next-generation sequencing (which can quickly identify the structure of millions of small fragments of DNA at the same time) to identify novel genes in Friedreich's ataxia.
