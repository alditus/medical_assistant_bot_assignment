Nablus mask-like facial syndrome is a rare microdeletion syndrome that is characterized by a mask-like facial appearance. Facial features include narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis); tight appearing glistening facial skin; and flat and broad nose. Other features include malformed ears; unusual scalp hair pattern; permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly); joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement in the hands and feet; unusual dentition; mild developmental delay; undescended testicles in males (cryptorchidism); and a happy disposition. This condition is caused by a deletion at chromosome 8q22.1.
