Domestic violence is a type of abuse. It usually involves a spouse or partner, but it can also be a child, elderly relative, or other family member.    Domestic violence may include       - Physical violence that can lead to injuries such as bruises or broken bones    - Sexual violence    - Threats of physical or sexual violence    - Emotional abuse that may lead to depression, anxiety, or social isolation       It is hard to know exactly how common domestic violence is, because people often don't report it. There is no typical victim. It happens among people of all ages. It affects those of all levels of income and education.    The first step in getting help is to tell someone you trust.
