Paget disease of bone is a disorder that involves abnormal bone destruction and regrowth, which results in deformity. This condition can affect any of the bones in the body; but most people have it in their spine, pelvis, skull, or leg bones. The disease may affect only one bone or several bones; but it does not affect the entire skeleton. Bones with Paget disease may break more easily, and the disease can lead to other health problems. The cause of Paget disease is unknown, although it may be associated with faulty genes or viral infections early in life.
 The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Paget disease of bone. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Bilateral conductive hearing impairment 40% Abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Bone pain - Brain stem compression - Cranial nerve paralysis - Elevated alkaline phosphatase - Fractures of the long bones - Heterogeneous - Hydroxyprolinuria - Increased susceptibility to fractures - Long-tract signs - Osteolysis - Paraparesis - Tetraparesis - Vertebral compression fractures - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.

Juvenile Paget disease is a disorder that affects bone growth. This disease causes bones to be abnormally large, misshapen, and easily broken (fractured).  The signs of juvenile Paget disease appear in infancy or early childhood. As bones grow, they become progressively weaker and more deformed. These abnormalities usually become more severe during the adolescent growth spurt, when bones grow very quickly.  Juvenile Paget disease affects the entire skeleton, resulting in widespread bone and joint pain. The bones of the skull tend to grow unusually large and thick, which can lead to hearing loss. The disease also affects bones of the spine (vertebrae). The deformed vertebrae can collapse, leading to abnormal curvature of the spine. Additionally, weight-bearing long bones in the legs tend to bow and fracture easily, which can interfere with standing and walking.
Juvenile Paget disease is rare; about 50 affected individuals have been identified worldwide.
Juvenile Paget disease is caused by mutations in the TNFRSF11B gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it.  Bones are constantly being remodeled, and the process is carefully controlled to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy. Mutations in the TNFRSF11B gene lead to a much faster rate of bone remodeling starting early in life. Bone tissue is broken down more quickly than usual, and when new bone tissue grows it is larger, weaker, and less organized than normal bone. This abnormally fast bone remodeling underlies the problems with bone growth characteristic of juvenile Paget disease.
This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

Classic Paget disease of bone occurs in approximately 1 percent of people older than 40 in the United States. Scientists estimate that about 1 million people in this country have the disease. It is most common in people of western European heritage.  Early-onset Paget disease of bone is much rarer. This form of the disorder has been reported in only a few families.
A combination of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing Paget disease of bone. Researchers have identified changes in several genes that increase the risk of the disorder. Other factors, including infections with certain viruses, may be involved in triggering the disease in people who are at risk. However, the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the development of Paget disease of bone remains unclear.  Researchers have identified variations in three genes that are associated with Paget disease of bone: SQSTM1, TNFRSF11A, and TNFRSF11B. Mutations in the SQSTM1 gene are the most common genetic cause of classic Paget disease of bone, accounting for 10 to 50 percent of cases that run in families and 5 to 30 percent of cases in which there is no family history of the disease. Variations in the TNFRSF11B gene also appear to increase the risk of the classic form of the disorder, particularly in women. TNFRSF11A mutations cause the early-onset form of Paget disease of bone.  The SQSTM1, TNFRSF11A, and TNFRSF11B genes are involved in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. Bones are constantly being remodeled, and the process is carefully controlled to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy. Paget disease of bone disrupts the bone remodeling process. Affected bone is broken down abnormally and then replaced much faster than usual. When the new bone tissue grows, it is larger, weaker, and less organized than normal bone. It is unclear why these problems with bone remodeling affect some bones but not others in people with this disease.  Researchers are looking for additional genes that may influence a person's chances of developing Paget disease of bone. Studies suggest that genetic variations in certain regions of chromosome 2, chromosome 5, and chromosome 10 appear to contribute to disease risk. However, the associated genes on these chromosomes have not been identified.
In 15 to 40 percent of all cases of classic Paget disease of bone, the disorder has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that having one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  In the remaining cases, the inheritance pattern of classic Paget disease of bone is unclear. Many affected people have no family history of the disease, although it sometimes clusters in families. Studies suggest that close relatives of people with classic Paget disease of bone are 7 to 10 times more likely to develop the disease than people without an affected relative.  Early-onset Paget disease of bone is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In people with this form of the disorder, having one altered copy of the TNFRSF11A gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disease.
