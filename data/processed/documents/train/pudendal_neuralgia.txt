Pudendal neuralgia occurs when the pudendal nerve is injured or compressed.  Symptoms include pain, burning, tingling, or numbness in the pelvic or buttock areas; symptoms worsen while an affected individual is in a sitting position.  The cause of pudendal neuralgia is unknown.  Treatment includes nerve block of the pudendal nerve or surgery to remove surrounding tissues that might be pressing on the nerve.
 There are no established guidelines for the treatment of pudendal neuralgia.  Treatment may include medications, the use of a specialized cushion while sitting, nerve block, surgery to remove nearby tissues that may be pressing on the pudendal nerve, or nerve stimulation.
