Having certain diseases and inherited disorders can increase the risk of childhood soft tissue sarcoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk.    Risk factors for childhood soft tissue sarcoma include having the following inherited disorders:         -  Li-Fraumeni syndrome.     -  Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).    -  Retinoblastoma 1 gene changes.    -  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).    -  Werner syndrome.        Other risk factors include the following:         - Past treatment with radiation therapy.    - Having AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and Epstein-Barr virus infection at the same time.
The most common sign of childhood soft tissue sarcoma is a painless lump or swelling in soft tissues of the body. A sarcoma may appear as a painless lump under the skin, often on an arm, a leg, or the trunk. There may be no other signs or symptoms at first. As the sarcoma gets bigger and presses on nearby organs, nerves, muscles, or blood vessels, it may cause signs or symptoms, such as pain or weakness.   Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms. Check with your childs doctor if your child has any of these problems.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The part of the body where the tumor first formed.    - The size and grade of the tumor.    - The type of soft tissue sarcoma.    - How deep the tumor is under the skin.    - Whether the tumor has spread to other places in the body.    - The amount of tumor remaining after surgery to remove it.    - Whether radiation therapy was used to treat the tumor.    - The age and gender of the patient.    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Gene therapy     Gene therapy is being studied for childhood synovial sarcoma that has recurred, spread, or cannot be removed by surgery. Some of the patient's T cells (a type of white blood cell) are removed and the genes in the cells are changed in a laboratory (genetically engineered) so that they will attack specific cancer cells. They are then given back to the patient by infusion.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.

                    Adult soft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the soft tissues of the body.
                    The soft tissues of the body include the muscles, tendons (bands of fiber that connect muscles to bones), fat, blood vessels, lymph vessels, nerves, and tissues around joints. Adult soft tissue sarcomas can form almost anywhere in the body, but are most common in the head, neck, arms, legs, trunk, and abdomen.     There are many types of soft tissue sarcoma. The cells of each type of sarcoma look different under a microscope, based on the type of soft tissue in which the cancer began.    See the following PDQ summaries for more information on soft tissue sarcomas:         -  Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment     -  Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors Treatment     -  Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Treatment     -  Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment     -  Uterine Sarcoma Treatment
Having certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of adult soft tissue sarcoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for soft tissue sarcoma include the following inherited disorders:         -  Retinoblastoma.    -  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; von Recklinghausen disease).    -  Tuberous sclerosis (Bourneville disease).    -  Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; Gardner syndrome).    -  Li-Fraumeni syndrome.    -  Werner syndrome (adult progeria).    -  Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome).        Other risk factors for soft tissue sarcoma include the following:         - Past treatment with radiation therapy for certain cancers.    - Being exposed to certain chemicals, such as Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), vinyl chloride, or arsenic.    - Having swelling (lymphedema) in the arms or legs for a long time.
A sign of adult soft tissue sarcoma is a lump or swelling in soft tissue of the body. A sarcoma may appear as a painless lump under the skin, often on an arm or a leg. Sarcomas that begin in the abdomen may not cause signs or symptoms until they get very big. As the sarcoma grows bigger and presses on nearby organs, nerves, muscles, or blood vessels, signs and symptoms may include:          - Pain.    - Trouble breathing.        Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.
Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery). The treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery) depend on the following:          - The type of soft tissue sarcoma.    - The size, grade, and stage of the tumor.    - How fast the cancer cells are growing and dividing.    - Where the tumor is in the body.     - Whether all of the tumor is removed by surgery.    - The patient's age and general health.    - Whether the cancer has recurred (come back).

Your soft tissues connect, support, or surround other tissues. Examples include your muscles, tendons, fat, and blood vessels. Soft tissue sarcoma is a cancer of these soft tissues. There are many kinds, based on the type of tissue they started in. They may cause a lump or swelling in the soft tissue. Sometimes they spread and can press on nerves and organs, causing problems such as pain or trouble breathing.    No one knows exactly what causes these cancers. They are not common, but you have a higher risk if you have been exposed to certain chemicals, have had radiation therapy, or have certain genetic diseases.    Doctors diagnose soft tissue sarcomas with a biopsy. Treatments include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination.    NIH: National Cancer Institute
