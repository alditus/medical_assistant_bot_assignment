Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), also called erythema multiforme major, is a limited form of toxic epidermal necrolysis. This disorder affects the skin, mucous membranes and eyes. Stevens-Johnson syndrome occurs twice as often in men as women, and most cases appear in children and young adults under 30, although it can develop in people at any age. Having a gene called HLA-B 1502, increases risk of having Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is an emergency medical condition that usually requires hospitalization. Treatment focuses on eliminating the underlying cause, controlling symptoms and minimizing complications and includes pain medication to reduce discomfort, medication to relieve itching (antihistamines), antibiotics to control infection, when needed and medication to reduce skin inflammation (topical steroids).
 The exact cause of Stevens-Johnson syndrome is unknown in 25 to 30% of cases. In those cases in which the cause can be determined, it is believed to be related to an adverse allergic drug reaction. Almost any drug--but most particularly sulfa drugs--can cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The allergic reaction to the drug may not occur until 7-14 days after first using it. Stevens-Johnson syndrome can also be preceded by a viral infection, such as herpes or the mumps. In rare cases, Stevens-Johnson syndrome may be caused by an illness or bone marrow transplantation.
 Stevens-Johnson syndrome may be difficult to treat.[2147] Patients should be admitted to an intensive care or burn unit as soon as the diagnosis is suspected.[2145][2147] Treatment of severe symptoms may include:[2147] Antibiotics to control any skin infections Corticosteroids to control inflammation Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) to stop the disease process Treatment for the eye may include artificial tears, antibiotics, or corticosteroids.[2144]
