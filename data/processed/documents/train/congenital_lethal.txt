The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the hip bone 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the lungs 90% Hypertelorism 90% Short stature 90% Skeletal muscle atrophy 90% Abnormal cortical bone morphology 50% Abnormality of the elbow 50% Abnormality of the ribs 50% Amniotic constriction ring 50% Limitation of joint mobility 50% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 50% Polyhydramnios 50% Recurrent fractures 50% Short neck 50% Slender long bone 50% Webbed neck 50% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 7.5% Abnormality of the amniotic fluid - Abnormality of the thorax - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Edema - Hypoplasia of the musculature - Neonatal death - Paucity of anterior horn motor neurons - Pulmonary hypoplasia - Widening of cervical spinal canal - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.
