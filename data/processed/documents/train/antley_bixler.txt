Antley Bixler syndrome is a rare condition that is primarily characterized by craniofacial abnormalities and other skeletal problems. The signs and symptoms vary significantly from person to person but may include craniosynostosis; midface hypoplasia (underdeveloped middle region of the face); frontal bossing; protruding eyes; low-set, unusually-formed ears; choanal atresia or stenosis (narrowing); fusion of adjacent arm bones (synostosis); joint contractures; arachnodactyly; bowing of the thigh bones; and/or urogenital (urinary tract and genital) abnormalities. The exact underlying cause of Antley Bixler syndrome is unknown in many cases; however, some are due to changes (mutations) in the FGFR2 gene or the POR gene. There appear to be autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of the condition. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.
