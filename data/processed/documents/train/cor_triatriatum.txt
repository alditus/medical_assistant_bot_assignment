Cor triatriatum is an extremely rare congenital (present at birth) heart defect. The human heart normally has four chambers, two ventricles and two atria. The two atria are normally separated from each other by a partition called the atrial septum and the two ventricles by the ventricle septum. In cor triatriatum there is a small extra chamber above the left atrium (cor triatriatum sinistrum) or right atrium (cor triatriatum dextrum). The presence of this extra atrial chamber can cause slowed passage of the blood from the lungs to the heart and, over time, lead to features of congestive heart failure and obstruction. In children, cor triatriatum may be associated with major congenital cardiac problems. In adults, it is often an isolated finding. Treatment depends upon the symptoms present and may include medical or surgical approaches.
