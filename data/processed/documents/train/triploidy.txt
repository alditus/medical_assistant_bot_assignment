Triploidy is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is an extra set of chromosomes present in each cell. Most pregnancies affected by triploidy are lost through early miscarriage. However, reports exist of some affected babies living up to five months. Those that survive are often mosaic. The signs and symptoms associated with triploidy vary but may include a variety of birth defects and an unusually small size. This condition does not run in families and is not associated with maternal or paternal age. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.
 The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Triploidy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.
