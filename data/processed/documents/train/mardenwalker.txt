Marden-Walker syndrome is a connective tissue disorder characterized by a mask-like face with blepharophimosis (a narrowing of the eye opening), micrognathia, cleft or high-arched palate, low-set ears, congenital joint contractures, decreased muscular mass, failure to thrive and psychomotor retardation (a generalized slowing down of physical reactions, movements, and speech). While the underlying cause has not been clearly established, it is believed to be a developmental disorder of the central nervous system which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
 The underlying cause of Marden-Walker syndrome has not been clearly established. It appears to be a developmental disorder of the central nervous system and is likely to be the expression of various heterogeneous diseases.
 Marden-Walker syndrome is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner since cases of affected siblings and parental consanguinity (the parents of the child with the condition are related to each other) have been reported.
 Very little information is available regarding the treatment of Marden-Walker syndrome. In general, treatment is symptomatic, with a multidisciplinary approach. The team of providers may include a regular pediatrician, a geneticist, a neurologist, an orthopedist and/or a physical medicine specialist. Special diets and feeding techniques may be of benefit. Early childhood intervention services may help with developmental problems. Other treatments are dependent upon the specific symptoms present in each patient.
